\wfbSection{Introduction}

\wfbCategory{Background}\\
\wfbText{In February 2007, the Iles Eparses became an integral part of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands (TAAF). The Southern Lands are now divided into five administrative districts, two of which are archipelagos, Iles Crozet and Iles Kerguelen; the third is a district composed of two volcanic islands, Ile Saint-Paul and Ile Amsterdam; the fourth, Iles Eparses, consists of five scattered tropical islands around Madagascar. They contain no permanent inhabitants and are visited only by researchers studying the native fauna, scientists at the various scientific stations, fishermen, and military personnel. The fifth district is the Antarctic portion, which consists of ''Adelie Land,'' a thin slice of the Antarctic continent discovered and claimed by the French in 1840.}\\
\wfbSubCategory{Ile Amsterdam}{Discovered but not named in 1522 by the Spanish, the island subsequently received the appellation of Nieuw Amsterdam from a Dutchman; it was claimed by France in 1843. A short-lived attempt at cattle farming began in 1871. A French meteorological station established on the island in 1949 is still in use.}\\
\wfbSubCategory{Ile Saint Paul}{Claimed by France since 1893, the island was a fishing industry center from 1843 to 1914. In 1928, a spiny lobster cannery was established, but when the company went bankrupt in 1931, seven workers were abandoned. Only two survived until 1934 when rescue finally arrived.}\\
\wfbSubCategory{Iles Crozet}{A large archipelago formed from the Crozet Plateau, Iles Crozet is divided into two main groups: L'Occidental (the West), which includes Ile aux Cochons, Ilots des Apotres, Ile des Pingouins, and the reefs Brisants de l'Heroine; and L'Oriental (the East), which includes Ile d'Est and Ile de la Possession (the largest island of the Crozets). Discovered and claimed by France in 1772, the islands were used for seal hunting and as a base for whaling. Originally administered as a dependency of Madagascar, they became part of the TAAF in 1955.}\\
\wfbSubCategory{Iles Kerguelen}{This island group, discovered in 1772, is made up of one large island (Ile Kerguelen) and about 300 smaller islands. A permanent group of 50 to 100 scientists resides at the main base at Port-aux-Francais.}\\
\wfbSubCategory{Adelie Land}{The only non-insular district of the TAAF is the Antarctic claim known as ''Adelie Land.'' The US Government does not recognize it as a French dependency.}\\
\wfbSubCategory{Bassas da India}{A French possession since 1897, this atoll is a volcanic rock surrounded by reefs and is awash at high tide.}\\
\wfbSubCategory{Europa Island}{This heavily wooded island has been a French possession since 1897; it is the site of a small military garrison that staffs a weather station.}\\
\wfbSubCategory{Glorioso Islands}{A French possession since 1892, the Glorioso Islands are composed of two lushly vegetated coral islands (Ile Glorieuse and Ile du Lys) and three rock islets. A military garrison operates a weather and radio station on Ile Glorieuse.}\\
\wfbSubCategory{Juan de Nova Island}{Named after a famous 15th century Spanish navigator and explorer, the island has been a French possession since 1897. It has been exploited for its guano and phosphate. Presently a small military garrison oversees a meteorological station.}\\
\wfbSubCategory{Tromelin Island}{First explored by the French in 1776, the island came under the jurisdiction of Reunion in 1814. At present, it serves as a sea turtle sanctuary and is the site of an important meteorological station.}
