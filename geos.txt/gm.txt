Introduction

  Background:
    As Europe's largest economy and second most populous nation (after
    Russia), Germany is a key member of the continent's economic,
    political, and defense organizations. European power struggles immersed
    Germany in two devastating World Wars in the first half of the 20th
    century and left the country occupied by the victorious Allied powers
    of the US, UK, France, and the Soviet Union in 1945. With the advent of
    the Cold War, two German states were formed in 1949: the western
    Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern German Democratic
    Republic (GDR). The democratic FRG embedded itself in key Western
    economic and security organizations, the EC, which became the EU, and
    NATO, while the communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led
    Warsaw Pact. The decline of the USSR and the end of the Cold War
    allowed for German unification in 1990. Since then, Germany has
    expended considerable funds to bring Eastern productivity and wages up
    to Western standards. In January 1999, Germany and 10 other EU
    countries introduced a common European exchange currency, the euro.

    as its national anthem; in 1990, it became the national anthem for the
    reunited Germany


Economy

  Economy - overview:
    The German economy - the fifth largest economy in the world in PPP
    terms and Europe's largest - is a leading exporter of machinery,
    vehicles, chemicals, and household equipment and benefits from a highly
    skilled labor force. Like its Western European neighbors, Germany faces
    significant demographic challenges to sustained long-term growth. Low
    fertility rates and declining net immigration are increasing pressure
    on the country's social welfare system and necessitate structural
    reforms. Reforms launched by the government of Chancellor Gerhard
    SCHROEDER (1998-2005), deemed necessary to address chronically high
    unemployment and low average growth, has contributed to strong growth
    and falling unemployment. These advances, as well as a government
    subsidized, reduced working hour scheme, help explain the relatively
    modest increase in unemployment during the 2008-09 recession - the
    deepest since World War II - and its decrease to 5.3% in 2013. The new
    German government introduced a minimum wage of $11 per hour to take
    effect in 2015. Stimulus and stabilization efforts initiated in 2008
    and 2009 and tax cuts introduced in Chancellor Angela MERKEL's second
    term increased Germany's total budget deficit - including federal,
    state, and municipal - to 4.1% in 2010, but slower spending and higher
    tax revenues reduced the deficit to 0.8% in 2011 and in 2012 Germany
    reached a budget surplus of 0.1%. A constitutional amendment approved
    in 2009 limits the federal government to structural deficits of no more
    than 0.35% of GDP per annum as of 2016 though the target was already
    reached in 2012. Following the March 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster,
    Chancellor Angela MERKEL announced in May 2011 that eight of the
    country's 17 nuclear reactors would be shut down immediately and the
    remaining plants would close by 2022. Germany hopes to replace nuclear
    power with renewable energy. Before the shutdown of the eight reactors,
    Germany relied on nuclear power for 23% of its electricity generating
    capacity and 46% of its base-load electricity production.
