Timor-Leste
===========


Introduction

  Background:
    The Portuguese began to trade with the island of Timor in the early
    16th century and colonized it in mid-century. Skirmishing with the
    Dutch in the region eventually resulted in an 1859 treaty in which
    Portugal ceded the western portion of the island. Imperial Japan
    occupied Portuguese Timor from 1942 to 1945, but Portugal resumed
    colonial authority after the Japanese defeat in World War II. East
    Timor declared itself independent from Portugal on 28 November 1975 and
    was invaded and occupied by Indonesian forces nine days later. It was
    incorporated into Indonesia in July 1976 as the province of Timor Timur
    (East Timor). An unsuccessful campaign of pacification followed over
    the next two decades, during which an estimated 100,000 to 250,000
    individuals lost their lives. On 30 August 1999, in a UN-supervised
    popular referendum, an overwhelming majority of the people of
    Timor-Leste voted for independence from Indonesia. However, in the next
    three weeks, anti-independence Timorese militias - organized and
    supported by the Indonesian military - commenced a large-scale,
    scorched-earth campaign of retribution. The militias killed
    approximately 1,400 Timorese and forcibly pushed 300,000 people into
    western Timor as refugees. Most of the country's infrastructure,
    including homes, irrigation systems, water supply systems, and schools,
    and nearly 100% of the country's electrical grid were destroyed. On 20
    September 1999, Australian-led peacekeeping troops deployed to the
    country and brought the violence to an end. On 20 May 2002, Timor-Leste
    was internationally recognized as an independent state. In 2006,
    internal tensions threatened the new nation's security when a military
    strike led to violence and a breakdown of law and order. At Dili's
    request, an Australian-led International Stabilization Force (ISF)
    deployed to Timor-Leste, and the UN Security Council established the UN
    Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT), which included an authorized
    police presence of over 1,600 personnel. The ISF and UNMIT restored
    stability, allowing for presidential and parliamentary elections in
    2007 in a largely peaceful atmosphere. In February 2008, a rebel group
    staged an unsuccessful attack against the president and prime minister.
    The ringleader was killed in the attack, and most of the rebels
    surrendered in April 2008. Since the attack, the government has enjoyed
    one of its longest periods of post-independence stability, including
    successful 2012 elections for both the parliament and president. In
    late 2012, the UN Security Council voted to end its peacekeeping
    mission in Timor-Leste and both the ISF and UNMIT departed the country
    by the end of the year.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Since its 1999 independence, Timor-Leste has faced great challenges in
    rebuilding its infrastructure, strengthening the civil administration,
    and generating jobs for young people entering the work force. The
    development of oil and gas resources in offshore waters has greatly
    supplemented government revenues. This technology-intensive industry,
    however, has done little to create jobs for the unemployed in part
    because there are no production facilities in Timor-Leste. Gas is piped
    to Australia. In June 2005, the National Parliament unanimously
    approved the creation of a Petroleum Fund to serve as a repository for
    all petroleum revenues and to preserve the value of Timor-Leste's
    petroleum wealth for future generations. The Fund held assets of US$9.3
    billion as of December 2011. The economy continues to recover from the
    mid-2006 outbreak of violence and civil unrest, which disrupted both
    private and public sector economic activity. Government spending
    increased markedly from 2009 through 2012, primarily on basic
    infrastructure, including electricity and roads. Limited experience in
    procurement and infrastructure building has hampered these projects.
    The underlying economic policy challenge the country faces remains how
    best to use oil-and-gas wealth to lift the non-oil economy onto a
    higher growth path and to reduce poverty. On the strength of its
    oil-wealth, the economy has achieved real growth between 8-12% per year
    for the last several years, among the highest sustained growth rates in
    the world.
