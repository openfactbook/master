Tonga

Introduction

  Background:
    Tonga - unique among Pacific nations - never completely lost its
    indigenous governance. The archipelagos of "The Friendly Islands" were
    united into a Polynesian kingdom in 1845. Tonga became a constitutional
    monarchy in 1875 and a British protectorate in 1900; it withdrew from
    the protectorate and joined the Commonwealth of Nations in 1970. Tonga
    remains the only monarchy in the Pacific.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Tonga has a small, open, South Pacific island economy. It has a narrow
    export base in agricultural goods. Squash, vanilla beans, and yams are
    the main crops. Agricultural exports, including fish, make up
    two-thirds of total exports. The country must import a high proportion
    of its food, mainly from New Zealand. The country remains dependent on
    external aid and remittances from Tongan communities overseas to offset
    its trade deficit. Tourism is the second-largest source of hard
    currency earnings following remittances. Tonga had 39,000 visitors in
    2006. The government is emphasizing the development of the private
    sector, especially the encouragement of investment, and is committing
    increased funds for health and education. Tonga has a reasonably sound
    basic infrastructure and well developed social services. High
    unemployment among the young, moderate inflation, pressures for
    democratic reform, and rising civil service expenditures are major
    issues facing the government.
