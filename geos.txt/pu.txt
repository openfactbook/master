Guinea-Bissau
=============


Introduction

  Background:
    Since independence from Portugal in 1974, Guinea-Bissau has experienced
    considerable political and military upheaval. In 1980, a military coup
    established authoritarian dictator Joao Bernardo 'Nino' VIEIRA as
    president. Despite setting a path to a market economy and multiparty
    system, VIEIRA's regime was characterized by the suppression of
    political opposition and the purging of political rivals. Several coup
    attempts through the 1980s and early 1990s failed to unseat him. In
    1994 VIEIRA was elected president in the country's first free
    elections. A military mutiny and resulting civil war in 1998 eventually
    led to VIEIRA's ouster in May 1999. In February 2000, a transitional
    government turned over power to opposition leader Kumba YALA after he
    was elected president in transparent polling. In September 2003, after
    only three years in office, YALA was overthrown in a bloodless military
    coup, and businessman Henrique ROSA was sworn in as interim president.
    In 2005, former President VIEIRA was re-elected president pledging to
    pursue economic development and national reconciliation; he was
    assassinated in March 2009. Malam Bacai SANHA was elected in an
    emergency election held in June 2009, but he passed away in January
    2012 from an existing illness. A military coup in April 2012 prevented
    Guinea-Bissau's second-round presidential election - to determine
    SANHA's successor - from taking place.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Guinea-Bissau's legal economy is based on farming and fishing, but
    trafficking in narcotics is probably the most lucrative economic
    activity. The combination of limited economic prospects, a weak and
    faction-ridden government, and favorable geography have made this West
    African country a way station for drugs bound for Europe. Cashew nuts
    are the main source of income for rural communities and the country's
    main export crop. Cashew sector performance helps to determine the
    overall macroeconomic situation of the country and food security status
    of rural areas. In 2013 cashew production and exports were disrupted as
    a result of the March 2012 coup. Guinea-Bissau is heavily reliant on
    foreign aid, which has not recovered to pre-coup levels.

    and Guinea; both boys and girls are forced to work as street vendors in
    cities in Guinea-Bissau and Senegal
    tier rating: Tier 3 - the government of Guinea-Bissau does not fully
    comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking
    and is not making significant efforts to do so; despite enacting an
    anti-trafficking law and finalizing and adopting a national action plan
    in 2011, authorities have not conducted any investigations or
    prosecutions of trafficking offenses; the government has not provided
    adequate protection to identified trafficking victims, conducted any
    tangible prevention activities in 2012, or made progress on the
    implementation of its national action plan (2013)

    to pervasive corruption; archipelago-like geography around the capital
    facilitates drug smuggling
