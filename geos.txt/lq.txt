Palmyra Atoll
=============

(territory of the US)


Introduction

  Background:
    The Kingdom of Hawaii claimed the atoll in 1862, and the US included it
    among the Hawaiian Islands when it annexed the archipelago in 1898. The
    Hawaii Statehood Act of 1959 did not include Palmyra Atoll, which is
    now part privately owned by the Nature Conservancy and part US
    Government-owned and administered as a nature preserve. The lagoons and
    surrounding waters within the 12-nautical-mile US territorial seas were
    transferred to the US Fish and Wildlife Service and were designated a
    National Wildlife Refuge in January 2001.
