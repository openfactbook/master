Introduction

  Background:
    Chad, part of France's African holdings until 1960, endured three
    decades of civil warfare, as well as invasions by Libya, before a
    semblance of peace was finally restored in 1990. The government
    eventually drafted a democratic constitution and held flawed
    presidential elections in 1996 and 2001. In 1998, a rebellion broke out
    in northern Chad, which has sporadically flared up despite several
    peace agreements between the government and the insurgents. In 2005,
    new rebel groups emerged in western Sudan and made probing attacks into
    eastern Chad despite signing peace agreements in December 2006 and
    October 2007. In June 2005, President Idriss DEBY held a referendum
    successfully removing constitutional term limits and won another
    controversial election in 2006. Sporadic rebel campaigns continued
    throughout 2006 and 2007. The capital experienced a significant
    insurrection in early 2008, but has had no significant rebel threats
    since then, in part due to Chad's 2010 rapprochement with Sudan, which
    previously used Chadian rebels as proxies. DEBY in 2011 was reelected
    to his fourth term in an election that international observers
    described as proceeding without incident. Power remains in the hands of
    an ethnic minority. In January 2014, Chad began a two year rotation on
    the UN Security Council.

  Geography - note:
    note 1: Chad is largest of Africa's 16 landlocked countries
    note 2: not long ago - geologically speaking - what is today the Sahara
    was green savanah teeming with wildlife; during the African Humid
    Period, roughly 11,000 to 5,000 years ago, a vibrant animal community,
    including elephants, giraffes, hippos, and antelope lived there; the
    last remnant of the "Green Sahara" exists in the Lakes of Ounianga
    (oo-nee-ahn-ga) in northern Chad, a series of 18 interconnected
    freshwater, saline, and hypersaline lakes now protected as a World
    Heritage site
    note 3: Lake Chad, the most significant water body in the Sahel, is a
    remnant of a former inland sea, paleolake Mega-Chad; at its greatest
    extent, sometime before 5000 B.C., Lake Mega-Chad was the largest of
    four Saharan paleolakes that existed during the African Humid Period;
    it covered an area of about 400,000 sq km (150,000 sq mi), i.e.,
    roughly the size of today's Caspian Sea

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Oil and agriculture drive Chad’s economy. At least 80% of Chad's
    population relies for its livelihood on subsistence farming and
    livestock raising and oil provides the bulk of export revenues. Cotton,
    cattle, and gum arabic provide the bulk of Chad's non-oil export
    earnings. Remittances have also been an important source of income and
    Chad relies on foreign assistance and foreign capital for most public
    and private sector investment. Oil production came on stream in late
    2003 and Chad began to export oil in 2004. Economic growth has been
    positive in recent years due to high oil prices and strong local
    harvests, but Chad’s fiscal situation is repeatedly exposed to
    declining oil prices and drought . Recently, the economy has been
    strained by the costs of repatriating Chadians fleeing the violence in
    South Sudan and the Central African Republic. Chad's investment climate
    remains challenging due to limited infrastructure, a lack of trained
    workers, extensive government bureaucracy, and corruption.

    established a joint border monitoring force with Sudan, which has

    members entrusting children to relatives or intermediaries in return
    for promises of education, apprenticeships, goods, or money; child
    trafficking victims are subjected to involuntary domestic servitude,
    forced cattle herding, forced begging, involuntary agricultural labor,
    or commercial sexual exploitation; some Chadian girls who travel to
    larger towns in search of work are forced into prostitution; in 2012,
    Chadian children were identified in some government military training
    centers and among rebel groups
