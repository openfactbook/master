Cyprus

Introduction

  Background:
    A former British colony, Cyprus became independent in 1960 following
    years of resistance to British rule. Tensions between the Greek Cypriot
    majority and Turkish Cypriot minority came to a head in December 1963,
    when violence broke out in the capital of Nicosia. Despite the
    deployment of UN peacekeepers in 1964, sporadic intercommunal violence
    continued forcing most Turkish Cypriots into enclaves throughout the
    island. In 1974, a Greek Government-sponsored attempt to overthrow the
    elected president of Cyprus was met by military intervention from
    Turkey, which soon controlled more than a third of the island. In 1983,
    the Turkish Cypriot-occupied area declared itself the "Turkish Republic
    of Northern Cyprus" ("TRNC"), but it is recognized only by Turkey. In
    February 2014, after a hiatus of nearly two years, the leaders of the
    two communities resumed formal discussions under UN auspices aimed at
    reuniting the divided island. The talks are ongoing. The entire island
    entered the EU on 1 May 2004, although the EU acquis - the body of
    common rights and obligations - applies only to the areas under the
    internationally recognized government, and is suspended in the areas
    administered by Turkish Cypriots. However, individual Turkish Cypriots
    able to document their eligibility for Republic of Cyprus citizenship
    legally enjoy the same rights accorded to other citizens of European
    Union states.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    The area of the Republic of Cyprus under government control has a
    market economy dominated by the service sector, which accounts for
    four-fifths of GDP. Tourism, financial services, and real estate have
    traditionally been the most important sectors. Cyprus has been a member
    of the European Union (EU) since May 2004 and adopted the euro as its
    national currency in January 2008. During the first five years of EU
    membership, the Cyprus economy grew at an average rate of about 4%,
    with unemployment between 2004 and 2008 averaging about 3%. An
    overextended banking sector with excessive exposure to Greek debt
    resulted in a contraction in economic growth. Two of Cyprus' biggest
    banks were among the largest holders of Greek bonds in Europe and had a
    substantial presence in Greece through bank branches and subsidiaries.
    Following numerous downgrades of its credit rating, Cyprus lost access
    to international capital markets in May 2011. The economy contracted by
    an accumulated 8.2% between 2009 and 2013 and is not expected to return
    to positive growth before 2015. Unemployment is currently over 17% and
    expected to reach 19% in 2014. In July 2012, Cyprus became the fifth
    eurozone government to request an economic bailout program from the
    European Commission, European Central Bank and the International
    Monetary Fund - known collectively as the "Troika". Shortly after the
    election of President Nicos ANASTASIADES in February 2013, Cyprus faced
    an economic crisis and agreed with the Troika to a $13 billion bailout
    that included losses on uninsured bank deposits. The bailout triggered
    a two-week bank closure and the imposition of capital controls, some of
    which remained in place through 2014. Cyprus' two largest banks merged
    and the combined entity was recapitalized through conversion of some
    large bank deposits to shares and imposition of losses on some bank
    bondholders. The Troika conditioned the bailout on progress in
    financial and structural reforms and privatization of state-owned
    enterprises. Cyprus has downsized and restructured its banking sector
    significantly. Three positive reviews by the Troika since May 2013
    indicate that Cyprus’ bailout program is on track with a fourth
    review scheduled in May 2014. In October 2013, Cyprus completed
    preliminary appraisal of hydrocarbon deposits in its territorial
    waters, which revealed less than anticipated natural gas reserves.
    Additional exploration drilling is likely to continue in 2014-2015.

  Economy of the area administered by Turkish Cypriots:
    Economy - overview: The market-based economy of the area administered
    by Turkish Cypriots, known locally as the "Turkish Republic of Northern
    Cyprus" ("TRNC"), is roughly half the size of its southern neighbor and
    is likewise dominated by the service sector with a large portion of the
    population employed by the government. Since its creation, the "TRNC"
    has heavily relied on financial assistance from Turkey which supports
    the "TRNC" defense, telecommunications, water and postal services, and
    the "TRNC" remains vulnerable to the Turkish market and monetary policy
    through its use of the Turkish Lira. The "TRNC" weathered the European
    financial crisis relatively unscathed-compared to the Republic of
    Cyprus-because of the lack of financial sector development, health of
    the Turkish economy, and its separation from the rest of the island.

    and maintains the buffer zone between north and south; on 1 May 2004,
    Cyprus entered the European Union still divided, with the EU's body of
    legislation and standards (acquis communitaire) suspended in the north;
    Turkey protests Cypriot Government creating hydrocarbon blocks and
    maritime boundary with Lebanon in March 2007

    suspicious transactions in offshore sector remains weak (2008)
