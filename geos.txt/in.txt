Introduction

  Background:
    The Indus Valley civilization, one of the world's oldest, flourished
    during the 3rd and 2nd millennia B.C. and extended into northwestern
    India. Aryan tribes from the northwest infiltrated the Indian
    subcontinent about 1500 B.C.; their merger with the earlier Dravidian
    inhabitants created the classical Indian culture. The Maurya Empire of
    the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C. - which reached its zenith under ASHOKA
    - united much of South Asia. The Golden Age ushered in by the Gupta
    dynasty (4th to 6th centuries A.D.) saw a flowering of Indian science,
    art, and culture. Islam spread across the subcontinent over a period of
    700 years. In the 10th and 11th centuries, Turks and Afghans invaded
    India and established the Delhi Sultanate. In the early 16th century,
    the Emperor BABUR established the Mughal Dynasty which ruled India for
    more than three centuries. European explorers began establishing
    footholds in India during the 16th century. By the 19th century, Great
    Britain had become the dominant political power on the subcontinent.
    The British Indian Army played a vital role in both World Wars. Years
    of nonviolent resistance to British rule, led by Mohandas GANDHI and
    Jawaharlal NEHRU, eventually resulted in Indian independence, which was
    granted in 1947. Large-scale communal violence took place before and
    after the subcontinent partition into two separate states - India and
    Pakistan. The neighboring nations have fought three wars since
    independence, the last of which was in 1971 and resulted in East
    Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh. India's nuclear
    weapons tests in 1998 emboldened Pakistan to conduct its own tests that
    same year. In November 2008, terrorists originating from Pakistan
    conducted a series of coordinated attacks in Mumbai, India's financial
    capital. Despite pressing problems such as significant overpopulation,
    environmental degradation, extensive poverty, and widespread
    corruption, economic growth following the launch of economic reforms in
    1991 and a massive youthful population are driving India's emergence as
    a regional and global power.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    India is developing into an open-market economy, yet traces of its past
    autarkic policies remain. Economic liberalization measures, including
    industrial deregulation, privatization of state-owned enterprises, and
    reduced controls on foreign trade and investment, began in the early
    1990s and served to accelerate the country's growth, which averaged
    under 7% per year from 1997 to 2011. India's diverse economy
    encompasses traditional village farming, modern agriculture,
    handicrafts, a wide range of modern industries, and a multitude of
    services. Slightly less than half of the work force is in agriculture,
    but, services are the major source of economic growth, accounting for
    nearly two-thirds of India's output with less than one-third of its
    labor force. India has capitalized on its large educated
    English-speaking population to become a major exporter of information
    technology services, business outsourcing services, and software
    workers. India's economic growth began slowing in 2011 because of a
    decline in investment, caused by high interest rates, rising inflation,
    and investor pessimism about the government's commitment to further
    economic reforms and about the global situation. In late 2012, the
    Indian Government announced additional reforms and deficit reduction
    measures, including allowing higher levels of foreign participation in
    direct investment in the economy. The outlook for India's long-term
    growth is moderately positive due to a young population and
    corresponding low dependency ratio, healthy savings and investment
    rates, and increasing integration into the global economy. However,
    India has many challenges that it has yet to fully address, including
    poverty, corruption, violence and discrimination against women and
    girls, an inefficient power generation and distribution system,
    ineffective enforcement of intellectual property rights, decades-long
    civil litigation dockets, inadequate transport and agricultural
    infrastructure, limited non-agricultural employment opportunities, high
    spending and poorly-targeted subsidies, inadequate availability of
    quality basic and higher education, and accommodating rural-to-urban
    migration. Growth in 2013 fell to a decade low, as India's economic
    leaders struggled to improve the country's wide fiscal and current
    account deficits. Rising macroeconomic imbalances in India and
    improving economic conditions in Western countries, led investors to
    shift capital away from India, prompting a sharp depreciation of the
    rupee. However, investors' perceptions of India improved in early 2014,
    due to a reduction of the current account deficit and expectations of
    post-election economic reform, resulting in a surge of inbound capital
    flows and stabilization of the rupee.
