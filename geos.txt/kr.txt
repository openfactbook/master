Kiribati
========


Introduction

  Background:
    The Gilbert Islands became a British protectorate in 1892 and a colony
    in 1915; they were captured by the Japanese in the Pacific War in 1941.
    The islands of Makin and Tarawa were the sites of major US amphibious
    victories over entrenched Japanese garrisons in 1943. The Gilbert
    Islands were granted self-rule by the UK in 1971 and complete
    independence in 1979 under the new name of Kiribati. The US
    relinquished all claims to the sparsely inhabited Phoenix and Line
    Island groups in a 1979 treaty of friendship with Kiribati.

  Natural hazards:
    typhoons can occur any time, but usually November to March; occasional
    tornadoes; low level of some of the islands make them sensitive to
    changes in sea level

  Environment - current issues:
    heavy pollution in lagoon of south Tarawa atoll due to heavy migration
    mixed with traditional practices such as lagoon latrines and open-pit
    dumping; ground water at risk

  Geography - note:
    21 of the 33 islands are inhabited; Banaba (Ocean Island) in Kiribati
    is one of the three great phosphate rock islands in the Pacific Ocean -

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    A remote country of 33 scattered coral atolls, Kiribati has few natural
    resources and is one of the least developed Pacific Islands.
    Commercially viable phosphate deposits were exhausted at the time of
    independence from the UK in 1979. Copra and fish now represent the bulk
    of production and exports. The economy has fluctuated widely in recent
    years. Economic development is constrained by a shortage of skilled
    workers, weak infrastructure, and remoteness from international
    markets. Tourism provides more than one-fifth of GDP. Private sector
    initiatives and a financial sector are in the early stages of
    development. Foreign financial aid from the EU, UK, US, Japan,
    Australia, New Zealand, Canada, UN agencies, and Taiwan accounts for
    20-25% of GDP. Remittances from seamen on merchant ships abroad account
    for more than $5 million each year. Kiribati receives around $15
    million annually for the government budget from an Australian trust
    fund.
