Pitcairn Islands
================

(overseas territory of the UK)


Introduction

  Background:
    Pitcairn Island was discovered in 1767 by the British and settled in
    1790 by the Bounty mutineers and their Tahitian companions. Pitcairn
    was the first Pacific island to become a British colony (in 1838) and
    today remains the last vestige of that empire in the South Pacific.
    Outmigration, primarily to New Zealand, has thinned the population from
    a peak of 233 in 1937 to less than 50 today.
