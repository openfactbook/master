Gambia, The
===========


Introduction

  Background:
    The Gambia gained its independence from the UK in 1965. Geographically
    surrounded by Senegal, it formed a short-lived federation of Senegambia
    between 1982 and 1989. In 1991 the two nations signed a friendship and
    cooperation treaty, but tensions have flared up intermittently since
    then. Yahya JAMMEH led a military coup in 1994 that overthrew the
    president and banned political activity. A new constitution and
    presidential elections in 1996, followed by parliamentary balloting in
    1997, completed a nominal return to civilian rule. JAMMEH has been
    elected president in all subsequent elections including most recently
    in late 2011.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    The Gambia has sparse natural resource deposits and a limited
    agricultural base, and relies in part on remittances from workers
    overseas and tourist receipts. About three-quarters of the population
    depends on the agricultural sector for its livelihood and the sector
    provides for about one-fifth of GDP. The agricultural sector has
    untapped potential - less than half of arable land is cultivated.
    Small-scale manufacturing activity features the processing of peanuts,
    fish, and hides. The Gambia's natural beauty and proximity to Europe
    has made it one of the larger markets for tourism in West Africa,
    boosted by government and private sector investments in eco-tourism and
    upscale facilities. In 2012, however, sluggish tourism led to a decline
    in GDP. Tourism brings in about one-fifth of GDP. Agriculture also took
    a hit in 2012 due to unfavorable weather patterns. The Gambia's
    re-export trade accounts for almost 80% of goods exports. Unemployment
    and underemployment rates remain high. Economic progress depends on
    sustained bilateral and multilateral aid, on responsible government
    economic management, and on continued technical assistance from
    multilateral and bilateral donors. International donors and lenders
    continue to be concerned about the quality of fiscal management and The
    Gambia's debt burden.

    current situation: The Gambia is a source, transit, and destination
    country for women and children subjected to forced labor and sex
    trafficking; Gambian women, children, and, to a lesser extent, boys are
    exploited for prostitution and domestic servitude; women, girls, and
    boys from West African countries are trafficked to the Gambia for
    sexual exploitation, particularly catering to European tourists seeking
    sex with children; some Gambian trafficking victims have been
    identified in neighboring West African countries and the UK; boys in
    some Koranic schools are forced into street vending or begging
