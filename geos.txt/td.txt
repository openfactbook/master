Trinidad and Tobago
===================


Introduction

  Background:
    First colonized by the Spanish, the islands came under British control
    in the early 19th century. The islands' sugar industry was hurt by the
    emancipation of the slaves in 1834. Manpower was replaced with the
    importation of contract laborers from India between 1845 and 1917,
    which boosted sugar production as well as the cocoa industry. The
    discovery of oil on Trinidad in 1910 added another important export.
    Independence was attained in 1962. The country is one of the most
    prosperous in the Caribbean thanks largely to petroleum and natural gas
    production and processing. Tourism, mostly in Tobago, is targeted for
    expansion and is growing. The government is coping with a rise in
    violent crime.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Trinidad and Tobago attracts considerable foreign direct investment
    from international businesses, particularly in energy, and has one of
    the highest per capita incomes in Latin America. Economic growth
    between 2000 and 2007 averaged slightly over 8% per year, significantly
    above the regional average of about 3.7% for that same period; however,
    GDP has slowed down since then and contracted during 2009-2011 due to
    depressed natural gas prices and changing markets. Growth had been
    fueled by investments in liquefied natural gas, petrochemicals, and
    steel with additional upstream and downstream investment planned.
    Trinidad and Tobago is the leading Caribbean producer of oil and gas,
    and its economy is heavily dependent upon these resources. It also
    supplies manufactured goods, notably food products and beverages, as
    well as cement to the Caribbean region. Oil and gas account for about
    40% of GDP and 80% of exports, but only 5% of employment. Oil
    production has declined over the last decade as the country focused the
    majority of its efforts on natural gas. The current administration has
    been working to arrest this decline by opening bid rounds and providing
    fiscal incentives for investments in on-shore and deep water acreage to
    boost oil reserves and production. The government keeps a close watch
    on the changing global gas markets and has shown flexibility in
    diversifying natural gas export destinations. Although Trinidad and
    Tobago enjoys cheap electricity from natural gas, the renewable energy
    sector has recently garnered increased interest. The country is also a
    regional financial center with a well-regulated and stable financial
    system. Other sectors the Government of Trinidad and Tobago targeted
    for increased investment and projected growth include tourism,
    agriculture, information and communications technology, and shipping.
    The economy benefits from a growing trade surplus with the US. The US
    is Trinidad and Tobago's leading trade partner. The previous MANNING
    administration benefited from fiscal surpluses fueled by the dynamic
    export sector; however, declines in oil and gas prices have reduced
    government revenues, challenging the current government's commitment to
    maintaining high levels of public investment. Crime and bureaucratic
    hurdles continue to be the biggest deterrents for attracting more
    foreign direct investment and business.

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago abide by the April 2006 Permanent
    Court of Arbitration decision delimiting a maritime boundary and
    limiting catches of flying fish in Trinidad and Tobago's exclusive
    economic zone; in 2005, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago agreed to
    compulsory international arbitration under United Nations Convention on
    the Law of the Sea challenging whether the northern limit of Trinidad
    and Tobago's and Venezuela's maritime boundary extends into Barbadian
    waters; Guyana has also expressed its intention to include itself in
    the arbitration as the Trinidad and Tobago-Venezuela maritime boundary
    may extend into its waters as well

  Trafficking in persons:
    current situation: Trinidad and Tobago is a destination and transit
    country for adults and children subjected to sex trafficking and adults
    subjected to forced labor; local victims have been trafficked to the US
    and the UK for sexual exploitation, while women and girls from South
    America and the Dominican Republic have been subjected to sex
    trafficking in Trinidad and Tobago's brothels and clubs; some economic
    migrants from the Caribbean region and Asia have had their passports
    held and experienced forced labor conditions; children are vulnerable
    to forced labor, including scavenging trash; the country is a potential
    transit point for human trafficking to Caribbean and South American
    destinations
    tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Trinidad and Tobago does not fully
    comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking;
    however, it is making significant efforts to do so; in 2013, the
    government proclaimed its anti-trafficking law and established a
    counter-trafficking unit, but authorities did not use the law to its
    full effect; despite victim protections in the new law, the government
    has failed to properly screen and protect hundreds of potential
    trafficking victims; the reported complicity of public officials in
    trafficking offenses is also an obstacle (2013)

  Illicit drugs:
    transshipment point for South American drugs destined for the US and
    Europe; producer of cannabis
