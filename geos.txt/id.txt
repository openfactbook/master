Indonesia
=========


Introduction

  Background:
    The Dutch began to colonize Indonesia in the early 17th century; Japan
    occupied the islands from 1942 to 1945. Indonesia declared its
    independence shortly before Japan's surrender, but it required four
    years of sometimes brutal fighting, intermittent negotiations, and UN
    mediation before the Netherlands agreed to transfer sovereignty in
    1949. A period of sometimes unruly parliamentary democracy ended in
    1957 when President SOEKARNO declared martial law and instituted
    "Guided Democracy." After an abortive coup in 1965 by alleged communist
    sympathizers, SOEKARNO was gradually eased from power. From 1967 until
    1988, President SUHARTO ruled Indonesia with his "New Order"
    government. After rioting toppled Suharto in 1998, free and fair
    legislative elections took place in 1999. Indonesia is now the world's
    third most populous democracy, the world's largest archipelagic state,
    and the world's largest Muslim-majority nation. Current issues include:
    alleviating poverty, improving education, preventing terrorism,
    consolidating democracy after four decades of authoritarianism,
    implementing economic and financial reforms, stemming corruption,
    reforming the criminal justice system, holding the military and police
    accountable for human rights violations, addressing climate change, and
    controlling infectious diseases, particularly those of global and
    regional importance. In 2005, Indonesia reached a historic peace
    agreement with armed separatists in Aceh, which led to democratic
    elections in Aceh in December 2006. Indonesia continues to face low
    intensity armed resistance in Papua by the separatist Free Papua
    Movement.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Indonesia, a vast polyglot nation, has grown strongly since 2010.
    During the global financial crisis, Indonesia outperformed its regional
    neighbors and joined China and India as the only G20 members posting
    growth. The government has promoted fiscally conservative policies,
    resulting in a debt-to-GDP ratio of less than 25% and historically low
    rates of inflation. Fitch and Moody's upgraded Indonesia's credit
    rating to investment grade in December 2011. Indonesia still struggles
    with poverty and unemployment, inadequate infrastructure, corruption, a
    complex regulatory environment, and unequal resource distribution among
    regions. The government also faces the challenges of quelling labor
    unrest and reducing fuel subsidies in the face of high oil prices.

    treaty that would settle the last of their maritime and EEZ boundary
    has yet to be ratified by Indonesia's legislature; Indonesian groups
    challenge Australia's claim to Ashmore Reef; Australia has closed parts
    of the Ashmore and Cartier Reserve to Indonesian traditional fishing
