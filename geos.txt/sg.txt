Senegal
=======


Introduction

  Background:
    The French colonies of Senegal and the French Sudan were merged in 1959
    and granted their independence as the Mali Federation in 1960. The
    union broke up after only a few months. Senegal joined with The Gambia
    to form the nominal confederation of Senegambia in 1982. The envisaged
    integration of the two countries was never carried out, and the union
    was dissolved in 1989. The Movement of Democratic Forces in the
    Casamance (MFDC) has led a low-level separatist insurgency in southern
    Senegal since the 1980s, and several peace deals have failed to resolve
    the conflict. Nevertheless, Senegal remains one of the most stable
    democracies in Africa and has a long history of participating in
    international peacekeeping and regional mediation. Senegal was ruled by
    a Socialist Party for 40 years until Abdoulaye WADE was elected
    president in 2000. He was reelected in 2007 and during his two terms
    amended Senegal's constitution over a dozen times to increase executive
    power and to weaken the opposition. His decision to run for a third
    presidential term sparked a large public backlash that led to his
    defeat in a March 2012 runoff election with Macky SALL.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Senegal’s economy is driven by agriculture and that sector is the
    primary source of employment for the rural areas. The country's key
    export industries are phosphate mining, fertilizer production, and
    commercial fishing. The country is also working on iron ore and oil
    exploration projects. senegal relies heavily on donor assistance and
    foreign direct investment. President Macky SALL, who was elected in
    March 2012 under a reformist policy agenda, inherited an economy with a
    weak infrastructure, challenging business environment, and a culture of
    overspending that still plagued the country in 2013. The IMF completed
    a non-dispersing, Policy Support Initiative program in December 2010
    and approved a new three-year policy support instrument to assist with
    economic reforms. The economy continues to suffer from unreliable power
    supplies and rising costs of living, which has led to public protests
    and high unemployment and has prompted migrants to flee Senegal in
    search of better job opportunities in Europe.
