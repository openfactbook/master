Uganda
======


Introduction

  Background:
    The colonial boundaries created by Britain to delimit Uganda grouped
    together a wide range of ethnic groups with different political systems
    and cultures. These differences prevented the establishment of a
    working political community after independence was achieved in 1962.
    The dictatorial regime of Idi AMIN (1971-79) was responsible for the
    deaths of some 300,000 opponents; guerrilla war and human rights abuses
    under Milton OBOTE (1980-85) claimed at least another 100,000 lives.
    The rule of Yoweri MUSEVENI since 1986 has brought relative stability
    and economic growth to Uganda. A constitutional referendum in 2005
    cancelled a 19-year ban on multi-party politics.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Uganda has substantial natural resources, including fertile soils,
    regular rainfall, small deposits of copper, gold, and other minerals,
    and recently discovered oil. Uganda has never conducted a national
    minerals survey. Agriculture is the most important sector of the
    economy, employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee accounts for the
    bulk of export revenues. Since 1986, the government - with the support
    of foreign countries and international agencies - has acted to
    rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking currency reform,
    raising producer prices on export crops, increasing prices of petroleum
    products, and improving civil service wages. The policy changes are
    especially aimed at dampening inflation and boosting production and
    export earnings. Since 1990 economic reforms ushered in an era of solid
    economic growth based on continued investment in infrastructure,
    improved incentives for production and exports, lower inflation, better
    domestic security, and the return of exiled Indian-Ugandan
    entrepreneurs. The global economic downturn hurt Uganda's exports;
    however, Uganda's GDP growth has largely recovered due to past reforms
    and sound management of the downturn. Oil revenues and taxes will
    become a larger source of government funding as oil comes on line in
    the next few years. Instability in South Sudan is a risk for the
    Ugandan economy because Uganda's main export partner is Sudan, and
    Uganda is a key destination for Sudanese refugees. Unreliable power,
    high energy costs, inadequate transportation infrastructure, and
    corruption inhibit economic development and investor confidence.
