Introduction

  Background:
    Lithuanian lands were united under MINDAUGAS in 1236; over the next
    century, through alliances and conquest, Lithuania extended its
    territory to include most of present-day Belarus and Ukraine. By the
    end of the 14th century Lithuania was the largest state in Europe. An
    alliance with Poland in 1386 led the two countries into a union through
    the person of a common ruler. In 1569, Lithuania and Poland formally
    united into a single dual state, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
    This entity survived until 1795 when its remnants were partitioned by
    surrounding countries. Lithuania regained its independence following
    World War I but was annexed by the USSR in 1940 - an action never
    recognized by the US and many other countries. On 11 March 1990,
    Lithuania became the first of the Soviet republics to declare its
    independence, but Moscow did not recognize this proclamation until
    September of 1991 (following the abortive coup in Moscow). The last
    Russian troops withdrew in 1993. Lithuania subsequently restructured
    its economy for integration into Western European institutions; it
    joined both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004. In January 2014,
    Lithuania assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for
    the 2014-15 term.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Lithuania gained membership in the World Trade Organization and joined
    the EU in May 2004. Despite its EU accession, Lithuania's trade with
    its Central and Eastern European neighbors, and Russia in particular,
    accounts for a significant share of total trade. Foreign investment and
    business support have helped in the transition from the old command
    economy to a market economy. The three former Soviet Baltic republics
    were among the hardest hit by the 2008-09 financial crisis. The
    government's efforts to attract foreign investment, to develop export
    markets, and to pursue broad economic reforms has been key to
    Lithuania's quick recovery from a deep recession, making Lithuania one
    of the fastest growing economies in the EU. Lithuania is committed to
    meeting the Maastricht criteria to join the euro zone, which the
    government expects to achieve by 2015. Under the Conservative Party's
    leadership, Lithuania raised the monthly minimum wage in January 2012
    nearly 25% over 2011. In January 2013, the new Social Democrat-led
    government increased the minimum wage another 25% over January 2012.
    Despite government efforts, unemployment remains high.
