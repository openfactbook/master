Bouvet Island
=============

(territory of Norway)


Introduction

  Background:
    This uninhabited, volcanic, Antarctic island is almost entirely covered
    by glaciers making it difficult to approach; it is recognized as the
    most remote island on Earth. Bouvet Island was discovered in 1739 by a
    French naval officer after whom it is named. No claim was made until
    1825, when the British flag was raised. In 1928, the UK waived its
    claim in favor of Norway, which had occupied the island the previous
    year. In 1971, Norway designated Bouvet Island and the adjacent
    territorial waters a nature reserve. Since 1977, Norway has run an
    automated meteorological station and studied foraging strategies and
    distribution of fur seals and penguins on the island.
