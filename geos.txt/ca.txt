Introduction

  Background:
    A land of vast distances and rich natural resources, Canada became a
    self-governing dominion in 1867 while retaining ties to the British
    crown. Economically and technologically, the nation has developed in
    parallel with the US, its neighbor to the south across the world's
    longest unfortified border. Canada faces the political challenges of
    meeting public demands for quality improvements in health care,
    education, social services, and economic competitiveness, as well as
    responding to the particular concerns of predominantly francophone
    Quebec. Canada also aims to develop its diverse energy resources while
    maintaining its commitment to the environment.


Geography

  Location:
    Northern North America, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean on the east,
    North Pacific Ocean on the west, and the Arctic Ocean on the north,
    north of the conterminous US

  Geographic coordinates:
    60 00 N, 95 00 W

  Map references:
    North America

  Area:
    total: 9,984,670 sq km
    land: 9,093,507 sq km
    water: 891,163 sq km

  Area - comparative:
    slightly larger than the US

  Land boundaries:
    total: 8,893 km
    border countries: US 8,893 km (includes 2,477 km with Alaska)
    note: Canada is the World's largest country that borders only one
    country

  Coastline:
    202,080 km

  Maritime claims:
    territorial sea: 12 nm
    contiguous zone: 24 nm
    exclusive economic zone: 200 nm
    continental shelf: 200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin

  Climate:
    varies from temperate in south to subarctic and arctic in north

  Terrain:
    mostly plains with mountains in west and lowlands in southeast

  Elevation extremes:
    lowest point: Atlantic Ocean 0 m
    highest point: Mount Logan 5,959 m

  Natural resources:
    iron ore, nickel, zinc, copper, gold, lead, rare earth elements,
    molybdenum, potash, diamonds, silver, fish, timber, wildlife, coal,
    petroleum, natural gas, hydropower

  Land use:

    total: 42.2 cu km/yr (20%/70%/10%)
    per capita: 1,589 cu m/yr (2010)

  Natural hazards:
    continuous permafrost in north is a serious obstacle to development;
    cyclonic storms form east of the Rocky Mountains, a result of the
    mixing of air masses from the Arctic, Pacific, and North American
    interior, and produce most of the country's rain and snow east of the
    mountains
    volcanism: the vast majority of volcanoes in Western Canada's Coast
    Mountains remain dormant

  Environment - current issues:
    air pollution and resulting acid rain severely affecting lakes and
    damaging forests; metal smelting, coal-burning utilities, and vehicle
    emissions impacting on agricultural and forest productivity; ocean
    waters becoming contaminated due to agricultural, industrial, mining,
    and forestry activities

  Environment - international agreements:
    party to: Air Pollution, Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides, Air
    Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants, Air Pollution-Sulfur 85, Air
    Pollution-Sulfur 94, Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine
    Living Resources, Antarctic Seals, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity,
    Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental
    Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone
    Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber
    94, Wetlands
    signed, but not ratified: Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds,
    Marine Life Conservation

  Geography - note:
    second-largest country in world (after Russia) and largest in the
    Americas; strategic location between Russia and US via north polar
    route; approximately 90% of the population is concentrated within 160
    km (100 mi) of the US border; Canada has more fresh water than any
    other country and almost 9% of Canadian territory is water; Canada has
    at least 2 million and possibly over 3 million lakes - that is more
    than all other countries combined

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    As a high-tech industrial society in the trillion-dollar class, Canada
    resembles the US in its market-oriented economic system, pattern of
    production, and high living standards. Since World War II, the
    impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has
    transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one primarily
    industrial and urban. The 1989 US-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and
    the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) (which includes
    Mexico) touched off a dramatic increase in trade and economic
    integration with the US, its principal trading partner. Canada enjoys a
    substantial trade surplus with the US, which absorbs about
    three-fourths of Canadian merchandise exports each year. Canada is the
    US's largest foreign supplier of energy, including oil, gas, uranium,
    and electric power. Given its abundant natural resources, highly
    skilled labor force, and modern capital plant, Canada enjoyed solid
    economic growth from 1993 through 2007. Buffeted by the global economic
    crisis, the economy dropped into a sharp recession in the final months
    of 2008, and Ottawa posted its first fiscal deficit in 2009 after 12
    years of surplus. Canada's major banks, however, emerged from the
    financial crisis of 2008-09 among the strongest in the world, owing to
    the financial sector's tradition of conservative lending practices and
    strong capitalization. Canada achieved marginal growth in 2010-13 and
    plans to balance the budget by 2015. In addition, the country's
    petroleum sector is rapidly expanding, because Alberta's oil sands
    significantly boosted Canada's proven oil reserves. Canada now ranks
    third in the world in proved oil reserves behind Saudi Arabia and
    Venezuela.
