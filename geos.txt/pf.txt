Paracel Islands
===============


Introduction

  Background:
    The Paracel Islands are surrounded by productive fishing grounds and by
    potential oil and gas reserves. In 1932, French Indochina annexed the
    islands and set up a weather station on Pattle Island; maintenance was
    continued by its successor, Vietnam. China has occupied all the Paracel
    Islands since 1974, when its troops seized a South Vietnamese garrison
    occupying the western islands. China built a military installation on
    Woody Island with an airfield and artificial harbor. The islands also
    are claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam.
