Solomon Islands
===============


Introduction

  Background:
    The UK established a protectorate over the Solomon Islands in the
    1890s. Some of the most bitter fighting of World War II occurred on
    this archipelago. Self-government was achieved in 1976 and independence
    two years later. Ethnic violence, government malfeasance, and endemic
    crime have undermined stability and civil society. In June 2003, then
    Prime Minister Sir Allan KEMAKEZA sought the assistance of Australia in
    reestablishing law and order; the following month, an Australian-led
    multinational force arrived to restore peace and disarm ethnic
    militias. The Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands
    (RAMSI) has generally been effective in restoring law and order and
    rebuilding government institutions.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    The bulk of the population depends on agriculture, fishing, and
    forestry for at least part of its livelihood. Most manufactured goods
    and petroleum products must be imported. The islands are rich in
    undeveloped mineral resources such as lead, zinc, nickel, and gold.
    Prior to the arrival of The Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon
    Islands (RAMSI), severe ethnic violence, the closing of key businesses,
    and an empty government treasury culminated in economic collapse.
    RAMSI's efforts to restore law and order and economic stability have
    led to modest growth as the economy rebuilds.

    current situation: The Solomon Islands is a source and destination
    country for local and Southeast Asian men and women subjected to forced
    labor and forced prostitution; women from China, Indonesia, Malaysia,
    and the Philippines are recruited for legitimate work and upon arrival
    are forced into prostitution; men from Indonesia and Malaysia recruited
    to work in the Solomon Islands' mining and logging industries may be
    subjected to forced labor; local children are forced into prostitution
    near foreign logging camps, on fishing vessels, and at hotel and other
    entertainment venues; some local children are also sold by their
    parents for marriage to foreign workers or put up for "informal
    adoption" and then find themselves forced into domestic servitude or
    forced prostitution
