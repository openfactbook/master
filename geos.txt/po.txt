Portugal
========


Introduction

  Background:
    Following its heyday as a global maritime power during the 15th and
    16th centuries, Portugal lost much of its wealth and status with the
    destruction of Lisbon in a 1755 earthquake, occupation during the
    Napoleonic Wars, and the independence of Brazil, its wealthiest colony,
    in 1822. A 1910 revolution deposed the monarchy; for most of the next
    six decades, repressive governments ran the country. In 1974, a
    left-wing military coup installed broad democratic reforms. The
    following year, Portugal granted independence to all of its African
    colonies. Portugal is a founding member of NATO and entered the EC (now
    the EU) in 1986.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Portugal has become a diversified and increasingly service-based
    economy since joining the European Community - the EU's predecessor -
    in 1986. Over the following two decades, successive governments
    privatized many state-controlled firms and liberalized key areas of the
    economy, including the financial and telecommunications sectors. The
    country qualified for the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in 1998 and
    began circulating the euro on 1 January 2002 along with 11 other EU
    members. The economy grew by more than the EU average for much of the
    1990s, but the rate of growth slowed in 2001-08. The economy contracted
    in 2009, and fell again from 2011 to 2013, as the government
    implemented spending cuts and tax increases to comply with conditions
    of an EU-IMF financial rescue package, signed in May 2011. Austerity
    measures also have contributed to record unemployment and a wave of
    emigration not seen since the 1960s. Booming exports will contribute to
    growth and employment in 2014, but the need to continue to reduce
    private- and public-sector debt could weigh on consumption and
    investment. The government of Pedro PASSOS COELHO has stated its
    intention to reduce labor market rigidity, and, this, along with steps
    to trim the budget deficit, could make Portugal more attractive to
    foreign investors. The government reduced the budget deficit from 10.1%
    of GDP in 2009 to 5.1% in 2013, lower than the EU-IMF fiscal target of
    5.5%. Despite these efforts, public debt has continued to grow and, in
    2013, stands among the highest in the EU. As a result, the government
    may have difficulty regaining full bond market financing when the
    EU-IMF financing program expires in May 2014.
