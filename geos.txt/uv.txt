Burkina Faso
============


Introduction

  Background:
    Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta) achieved independence from France
    in 1960. Repeated military coups during the 1970s and 1980s were
    followed by multiparty elections in the early 1990s. Current President
    Blaise COMPAORE came to power in a 1987 military coup and has won every
    election since then. There have been increasing protests over the
    belief that the president may try to run for a currently
    unconstitutional third term in the 2015 presidential elections. Burkina
    Faso's high population growth and limited natural resources result in
    poor economic prospects for the majority of its citizens.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Burkina Faso is a poor, landlocked country that depends on adequate
    rainfall. About 90% of the population is engaged in subsistence
    agriculture and cotton is the main cash crop. The country has few
    natural resources and a weak industrial base. Cotton and gold are key
    exports. Since 1998, Burkina Faso has begun to privatize state-owned
    enterprises and in 2004 revised its investment code to attract foreign
    investment. As a result, the country has seen an upswing in gold
    exploration, production, and export. The Burkinabe economy experienced
    high levels of growth over the last few years but growth is highly
    dependent on swings in gold and cotton prices. In 2013 Burkina Faso
    experienced a number of public protests over the cost of living,
    corruption, and other socioeconomic issues. To defuse tensions the
    government has offered higher housing bonuses, reduced income taxes,
    and price controls. Turmoil in neighboring Mali, unreliable energy
    supplies, and poor transportation links pose longer-term challenges.
