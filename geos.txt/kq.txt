Kingman Reef
============

(territory of the US)


Introduction

  Background:
    The US annexed the reef in 1922. Its sheltered lagoon served as a way
    station for flying boats on Hawaii-to-American Samoa flights during the
    late 1930s. There are no terrestrial plants on the reef, which is
    frequently awash, but it does support abundant and diverse marine fauna
    and flora. In 2001, the waters surrounding the reef out to 12 nm were
    designated a US National Wildlife Refuge.
