Kazakhstan
==========


Introduction

  Background:
    Ethnic Kazakhs, a mix of Turkic and Mongol nomadic tribes who migrated
    to the region by the 13th century, were rarely united as a single
    nation. The area was conquered by Russia in the 18th century, and
    Kazakhstan became a Soviet Republic in 1936. During the 1950s and 1960s
    agricultural "Virgin Lands" program, Soviet citizens were encouraged to
    help cultivate Kazakhstan's northern pastures. This influx of
    immigrants (mostly Russians, but also some other deported
    nationalities) skewed the ethnic mixture and enabled non-ethnic Kazakhs
    to outnumber natives. Non-Muslim ethnic minorities departed Kazakhstan
    in large numbers from the mid-1990s through the mid-2000s and a
    national program has repatriated about a million ethnic Kazakhs back to
    Kazakhstan. These trends have allowed Kazakhs to become the titular
    majority again. This dramatic demographic shift has also undermined the
    previous religious diversity and made the country more than 70 percent
    Muslim. Kazakhstan's economy is larger than those of all the other
    Central Asian states largely due to the country's vast natural
    resources. Current issues include: developing a cohesive national
    identity; managing Islamic revivalism; expanding the development of the
    country's vast energy resources and exporting them to world markets;
    diversifying the economy outside the oil, gas, and mining sectors;
    enhancing Kazakhstan's economic competitiveness; developing a
    multiparty parliament and advancing political and social reform; and
    strengthening relations with neighboring states and other foreign
    powers.


Geography

    Central Asia, northwest of China; a small portion west of the Ural
    (Zhayyq) River in eastern-most Europe

  Geographic coordinates:
    48 00 N, 68 00 E

  Map references:
    Asia

  Area:
    total: 2,724,900 sq km
    land: 2,699,700 sq km
    water: 25,200 sq km

  Area - comparative:
    slightly less than four times the size of Texas

  Land boundaries:
    total: 12,185 km
    border countries: China 1,533 km, Kyrgyzstan 1,224 km, Russia 6,846 km,
    Turkmenistan 379 km, Uzbekistan 2,203 km

  Coastline:
    0 km (landlocked); note - Kazakhstan borders the Aral Sea, now split
    into two bodies of water (1,070 km), and the Caspian Sea (1,894 km)

  Maritime claims:
    none (landlocked)

  Climate:
    continental, cold winters and hot summers, arid and semiarid

  Terrain:
    vast flat steppe extending from the Volga in the west to the Altai
    Mountains in the east and from the plains of western Siberia in the
    north to oases and deserts of Central Asia in the south

  Elevation extremes:
    lowest point: Vpadina Kaundy -132 m
    highest point: Khan Tangiri Shyngy (Pik Khan-Tengri) 6,995 m

  Natural resources:
    major deposits of petroleum, natural gas, coal, iron ore, manganese,
    chrome ore, nickel, cobalt, copper, molybdenum, lead, zinc, bauxite,
    gold, uranium

  Land use:
    arable land: 8.82%
    permanent crops: 0.03%
    other: 91.15% (2011)

    20,660 sq km (2010)

    per capita: 1,304 cu m/yr (2010)

  Natural hazards:
    earthquakes in the south; mudslides around Almaty

  Environment - current issues:
    radioactive or toxic chemical sites associated with former defense
    industries and test ranges scattered throughout the country pose health
    risks for humans and animals; industrial pollution is severe in some
    cities; because the two main rivers that flowed into the Aral Sea have
    been diverted for irrigation, it is drying up and leaving behind a
    harmful layer of chemical pesticides and natural salts; these
    substances are then picked up by the wind and blown into noxious dust
    storms; pollution in the Caspian Sea; soil pollution from overuse of
    agricultural chemicals and salination from poor infrastructure and
    wasteful irrigation practices

  Environment - international agreements:
    party to: Air Pollution, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification,
    Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Ozone
    Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands
    signed, but not ratified: Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol

  Geography - note:
    world's largest landlocked country; Russia leases approximately 6,000
    sq km of territory enclosing the Baykonur Cosmodrome; in January 2004,
    Kazakhstan and Russia extended the lease to 2050

    and energy, exemplifies wealth and plenitude; the sun's rays are shaped

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Kazakhstan, geographically the largest of the former Soviet republics,
    excluding Russia, possesses enormous fossil fuel reserves and plentiful
    supplies of other minerals and metals, such as uranium, copper, and
    zinc. It also has a large agricultural sector featuring livestock and
    grain. In 2002 Kazakhstan became the first country in the former Soviet
    Union to receive an investment-grade credit rating. Extractive
    industries have been and will continue to be the engine of Kazakhstan's
    growth, although the country is aggressively pursuing diversification
    strategies. Landlocked, with restricted access to the high seas,
    Kazakhstan relies on its neighbors to export its products, especially
    oil and grain. Although its Caspian Sea ports, pipelines, and rail
    lines carrying oil have been upgraded, civil aviation and roadways
    continue to need attention. Telecoms are improving, but require
    considerable investment, as does the information technology base.
    Supply and distribution of electricity can be erratic because of
    regional dependencies, but the country is moving forward with plans to
    improve reliability of electricity and gas supply to its population. At
    the end of 2007, global financial markets froze up and the loss of
    capital inflows to Kazakhstani banks caused a credit crunch. The
    subsequent and sharp fall of oil and commodity prices in 2008
    aggravated the economic situation, and Kazakhstan plunged into
    recession. While the global financial crisis took a significant toll on
    Kazakhstan's economy, it has rebounded well, helped by prudent
    government measures. Rising commodity prices have helped the recovery.
    Despite solid macroeconomic indicators, the government realizes that
    its economy suffers from an overreliance on oil and extractive
    industries, the so-called "Dutch disease." In response, Kazakhstan has
    embarked on an ambitious diversification program, aimed at developing
    targeted sectors like transport, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications,
    petrochemicals and food processing. In 2010 Kazakhstan joined the
    Belarus-Kazakhstan-Russia Customs Union in an effort to boost foreign
    investment and improve trade relationships.
