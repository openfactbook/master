Korea, North
============


Introduction

  Background:
    An independent kingdom for much of its long history, Korea was occupied
    by Japan beginning in 1905 following the Russo-Japanese War. Five years
    later, Japan formally annexed the entire peninsula. Following World War
    II, Korea was split with the northern half coming under
    Soviet-sponsored communist control. After failing in the Korean War
    (1950-53) to conquer the US-backed Republic of Korea (ROK) in the
    southern portion by force, North Korea (DPRK), under its founder
    President KIM Il Sung, adopted a policy of ostensible diplomatic and
    economic "self-reliance" as a check against outside influence. The DPRK
    demonized the US as the ultimate threat to its social system through
    state-funded propaganda, and molded political, economic, and military
    policies around the core ideological objective of eventual unification
    of Korea under Pyongyang's control. KIM Il Sung's son, KIM Jong Il, was
    officially designated as his father's successor in 1980, assuming a
    growing political and managerial role until the elder KIM's death in
    1994. KIM Jong Un was publicly unveiled as his father's successor in
    September 2010. Following KIM Jong Il's death in December 2011, the
    regime began to take actions to transfer power to KIM Jong Un and KIM
    has now assumed many his father's former titles and duties. After
    decades of economic mismanagement and resource misallocation, the DPRK
    since the mid-1990s has relied heavily on international aid to feed its
    population. The DPRK began to ease restrictions to allow semi-private
    markets, starting in 2002, but then sought to roll back the scale of
    economic reforms in 2005 and 2009. North Korea's history of regional
    military provocations; proliferation of military-related items;
    long-range missile development; WMD programs including tests of nuclear
    devices in 2006, 2009, and 2013; and massive conventional armed forces
    are of major concern to the international community. The regime in 2013
    announced a new policy calling for the simultaneous development of the
    North's nuclear weapons program and its economy.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    North Korea, one of the world's most centrally directed and least open
    economies, faces chronic economic problems. Industrial capital stock is
    nearly beyond repair as a result of years of underinvestment, shortages
    of spare parts, and poor maintenance. Large-scale military spending
    draws off resources needed for investment and civilian consumption.
    Industrial and power output have stagnated for years at a fraction of
    pre-1990 levels. Frequent weather-related crop failures aggravated
    chronic food shortages caused by on-going systemic problems, including
    a lack of arable land, collective farming practices, poor soil quality,
    insufficient fertilization, and persistent shortages of tractors and
    fuel. Large-scale international food aid deliveries have allowed the
    people of North Korea to escape widespread starvation since famine
    threatened in 1995, but the population continues to suffer from
    prolonged malnutrition and poor living conditions. Since 2002, the
    government has allowed private "farmers' markets" to begin selling a
    wider range of goods. It also permitted some private farming - on an
    experimental basis - in an effort to boost agricultural output. In
    December 2009, North Korea carried out a redenomination of its
    currency, capping the amount of North Korean won that could be
    exchanged for the new notes, and limiting the exchange to a one-week
    window. A concurrent crackdown on markets and foreign currency use
    yielded severe shortages and inflation, forcing Pyongyang to ease the
    restrictions by February 2010. In response to the sinking of the South
    Korean warship Cheonan and the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island, South
    Korea's government cut off most aid, trade, and bilateral cooperation
    activities, with the exception of operations at the Kaesong Industrial
    Complex. In preparation for the 100th anniversary of KIM Il-sung's
    birthday in 2012, North Korea continued efforts to develop special
    economic zones with China and expressed willingness to permit
    construction of a trilateral gas pipeline that would carry Russian
    natural gas to South Korea. The North Korean government often
    highlights its goal of becoming a "strong and prosperous" nation and
    attracting foreign investment, a key factor for improving the overall
    standard of living. In this regard, in 2013 the regime rolled out 14
    new Special Economic Zones set up for foreign investors, though the
    initiative remains in its infancy. Nevertheless, firm political control
    remains the government's overriding concern, which likely will inhibit
    changes to North Korea's current economic system.

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    risking arrest, imprisonment, and deportation, tens of thousands of
    North Koreans cross into China to escape famine, economic privation,
    and political oppression; North Korea and China dispute the sovereignty
    of certain islands in Yalu and Tumen rivers; Military Demarcation Line
    within the 4-km-wide Demilitarized Zone has separated North from South
    Korea since 1953; periodic incidents in the Yellow Sea with South Korea
    which claims the Northern Limiting Line as a maritime boundary; North
    Korea supports South Korea in rejecting Japan's claim to Liancourt
    Rocks (Tok-do/Take-shima)

  Refugees and internally displaced persons:
    IDPs: undetermined (periodic flooding and famine during mid-1990s)
    (2007)

  Trafficking in persons:
    current situation: North Korea is a source country for men, women, and
    children who are subjected to forced labor, forced marriage, and sex
    trafficking; in the recent past, many North Korean women and girls
    lured by promises of food, jobs, and freedom migrated to China
    illegally to escape poor social and economic conditions only to be
    forced into prostitution, marriage, or exploitative labor arrangements;
    North Koreans do not have a choice in the work the government assigns
    them and are not free to change jobs at will; many North Korean workers
    recruited to work abroad under bilateral contracts with foreign
    governments are subjected to forced labor and reportedly face
    government reprisals if they try to escape or complain to outsiders;
    thousands of North Koreans, including children, are subjected to forced
    labor in prison camps
    tier rating: Tier 3 - North Korea does not fully comply with minimum
    standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making
    significant efforts to do so; the government has conducted no known
    investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of trafficking offenders
    or officials complicit in forced labor or forced prostitution; the
    government also has reported no efforts to identify or assist
    trafficking victims and continues to deny human trafficking is a
    problem; authorities provide no discernible protection services to
    trafficking victims and does not permit NGOs to assist victims (2013)

  Illicit drugs:
    for years, from the 1970s into the 2000s, citizens of the Democratic
    People's Republic of (North) Korea (DPRK), many of them diplomatic
    employees of the government, were apprehended abroad while trafficking
    in narcotics, including two in Turkey in December 2004; police
    investigations in Taiwan and Japan in recent years have linked North
    Korea to large illicit shipments of heroin and methamphetamine,
    including an attempt by the North Korean merchant ship Pong Su to
    deliver 150 kg of heroin to Australia in April 2003
