Guernsey
========

(British crown dependency)


Introduction

  Background:
    Guernsey and the other Channel Islands represent the last remnants of
    the medieval Dukedom of Normandy, which held sway in both France and
    England. The islands were the only British soil occupied by German
    troops in World War II. Guernsey is a British crown dependency but is
    not part of the UK or of the European Union. However, the UK Government
    is constitutionally responsible for its defense and international
    representation.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Financial services - banking, fund management, insurance - account for
    about 23% of employment and about 55% of total income in this tiny,
    prosperous Channel Island economy. Tourism, manufacturing, and
    horticulture, mainly tomatoes and cut flowers, have been declining.
    Financial services, construction, retail, and the public sector have
    been growing. Light tax and death duties make Guernsey a popular tax
    haven. In January 2013, Guernsey signed a tax agreement with Jersey and
    the Isle of Man, in order to enable the islands' authorities to end tax
    avoidance and evasion. The evolving economic integration of the EU
    nations is changing the environment under which Guernsey operates.
