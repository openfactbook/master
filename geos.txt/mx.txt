Mexico

Introduction

  Background:
    The site of several advanced Amerindian civilizations - including the
    Olmec, Toltec, Teotihuacan, Zapotec, Maya, and Aztec - Mexico was
    conquered and colonized by Spain in the early 16th century.
    Administered as the Viceroyalty of New Spain for three centuries, it
    achieved its independence early in the 19th century. The global
    financial crisis beginning in late 2008 caused a massive economic
    downturn the following year, although growth returned quickly in 2010.
    Ongoing economic and social concerns include low real wages,
    underemployment for a large segment of the population, inequitable
    income distribution, and few advancement opportunities for the largely
    indigenous population in the impoverished southern states. The
    elections held in 2000 marked the first time since the 1910 Mexican
    Revolution that an opposition candidate - Vicente FOX of the National
    Action Party (PAN) - defeated the party in government, the
    Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). He was succeeded in 2006 by
    another PAN candidate Felipe CALDERON, but Enrique PENA NIETO regained
    the presidency for the PRI in 2012. Since 2007, Mexico's powerful
    drug-trafficking organizations have engaged in bloody feuding,
    resulting in tens of thousands of drug-related homicides.

    bravery, strength, and valor; the coat of arms is derived from a legend
    that the wandering Aztec people were to settle at a location where they
    would see an eagle on a cactus eating a snake; the city they founded,
    Tenochtitlan, is now Mexico City
    note: similar to the flag of Italy, which is shorter, uses lighter

    uninterested in submitting lyrics to a national anthem contest; his
    fiancee locked him in a room and refused to release him until the
    lyrics were completed


Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Mexico's $1.3 trillion economy has become increasingly oriented toward
    manufacturing in the 20 years since the North American Free Trade
    Agreement (NAFTA) entered into force. Per capita income is roughly
    one-third that of the US; income distribution remains highly unequal.
    Mexico has become the United States' second-largest export market and
    third-largest source of imports. In 2013, two-way merchandise trade
    reached nearly $507 billion. Mexico has free trade agreements with over
    50 countries including Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, the European
    Free Trade Area, and Japan - putting more than 90% of trade under free
    trade agreements. In 2012 Mexico formally joined the Trans-Pacific
    Partnership negotiations and formed the Pacific Alliance with Peru,
    Colombia and Chile. Mexico's current government, led by President
    Enrique PENA NIETO, emphasized economic reforms during its first year
    in office, passing education, energy, financial, fiscal and
    telecommunications reform legislation. The three-party "Pact for
    Mexico" reform agenda aims to improve competitiveness and economic
    growth across the Mexican economy.
