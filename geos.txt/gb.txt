Introduction

  Background:
    El Hadj Omar BONGO Ondimba - one of the longest-serving heads of state
    in the world - dominated the country's political scene for four decades
    (1967-2009) following independence from France in 1960. President BONGO
    introduced a nominal multiparty system and a new constitution in the
    early 1990s. However, allegations of electoral fraud during local
    elections in December 2002 and the presidential elections in 2005
    exposed the weaknesses of formal political structures in Gabon.
    Following President BONGO's death in 2009, new elections brought Ali
    BONGO Ondimba, son of the former president, to power. Despite
    constrained political conditions, Gabon's small population, abundant
    natural resources, and considerable foreign support have helped make it
    one of the more stable African countries.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Gabon enjoys a per capita income four times that of most sub-Saharan
    African nations, but because of high income inequality, a large
    proportion of the population remains poor. Gabon depended on timber and
    manganese until oil was discovered offshore in the early 1970s. The
    economy was reliant on oil for about 50% of its GDP, about 70% of
    revenues, and 87% of goods exports for 2010, although some fields have
    passed their peak production. A rebound of oil prices from 1999 to 2008
    helped growth, but declining production has hampered Gabon from fully
    realizing potential gains. Gabon signed a 14-month Stand-By Arrangement
    with the IMF in May 2007, and later that year issued a $1 billion
    sovereign bond to buy back a sizable portion of its Paris Club debt.
    Gabon continues to face fluctuating prices for its oil, timber, and
    manganese exports. Despite the abundance of natural wealth, poor fiscal
    management has stifled the economy. However, President BONGO ONDIMBA
    has made efforts to increase transparency and is taking steps to make
    Gabon a more attractive investment destination to diversify the
    economy. BONGO ONDIMBA has attempted to boost growth by increasing
    government investment in human resources and infrastructure. GDP grew
    more than 6% per year over the 2010-13 period.
