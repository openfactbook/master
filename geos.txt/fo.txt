Faroe Islands
=============

(part of the Kingdom of Denmark)


Introduction

  Background:
    The population of the Faroe Islands is largely descended from Viking
    settlers who arrived in the 9th century. The islands have been
    connected politically to Denmark since the 14th century. A high degree
    of self-government was granted the Faroese in 1948, who have autonomy
    over most internal affairs while Denmark is responsible for justice,
    defense, and foreign affairs. The Faroe Islands are not part of the
    European Union.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    The Faroese economy is dependent on fishing, which makes the economy
    vulnerable to price fluctuations. The sector normally accounts for
    about 95% of exports and nearly half of GDP. In early 2008 the Faroese
    economy began to slow as a result of smaller catches and historically
    high oil prices. The slowdown in the Faroese economy followed a strong
    performance since the mid-1990s with annual growth rates averaging
    close to 6%, mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon
    farming, and high export prices. Unemployment reached its lowest level
    in June 2008 at 1.1% but gradually increased to about 5.5% in 2012. The
    Faroese Home Rule Government produced increasing budget surpluses in
    that period, which helped to reduce the large public debt, most of it
    to Denmark. However, total dependence on fishing and salmon farming
    make the Faroese economy vulnerable to fluctuations in world demand.
    Initial discoveries of oil in the Faroese area give hope for eventual
    oil production, which may provide a foundation for a more diversified
    economy and less dependence on Danish economic assistance. Aided by an
    annual subsidy from Denmark amounting to about 3% of Faroese GDP, the
    Faroese have a standard of living almost equal to that of Denmark and
    Greenland. The Faroese Government ran relatively large deficits from
    2008 to 2010 and budget deficits are forecast for several years ahead.
    At year-end 2010 gross external debt had reached approximately US$900
    million.
