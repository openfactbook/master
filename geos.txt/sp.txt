Spain
=====


Introduction

  Background:
    Spain's powerful world empire of the 16th and 17th centuries ultimately
    yielded command of the seas to England. Subsequent failure to embrace
    the mercantile and industrial revolutions caused the country to fall
    behind Britain, France, and Germany in economic and political power.
    Spain remained neutral in World War I and II but suffered through a
    devastating civil war (1936-39). A peaceful transition to democracy
    following the death of dictator Francisco FRANCO in 1975, and rapid
    economic modernization (Spain joined the EU in 1986) gave Spain a
    dynamic and rapidly growing economy and made it a global champion of
    freedom and human rights. More recently the government has had to focus
    on measures to reverse a severe economic recession that began in
    mid-2008. Austerity measures implemented to reduce a large budget
    deficit and reassure foreign investors have led to one of the highest
    unemployment rates in Europe.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Spain experienced a prolonged recession in the wake of the global
    financial crisis. GDP contracted by 3.7% in 2009, ending a 16-year
    growth trend, and continued contracting through most of 2013. Economic
    growth resumed in late 2013, albeit only modestly, as credit
    contraction in the private sector, fiscal austerity, and high
    unemployment continued to weigh on domestic consumption and investment.
    Exports, however, have been resilient throughout the economic downturn,
    partially offsetting declines in domestic consumption and helped to
    bring Spain's current account into surplus in 2013 for the first time
    since 1986. The unemployment rate rose from a low of about 8% in 2007
    to more than 26% in 2013, straining Spain's public finances as spending
    on social benefits increased while tax revenues fell. Spain’s budget
    deficit peaked at 11.4% of GDP in 2009. Spain gradually reduced the
    deficit to just under 7% of GDP in 2013, slightly above the 6.5% target
    negotiated between Spain and the EU. Public debt has increased
    substantially – from 60.1% of GDP in 2010 to 93.4% in 2013. Rising
    labor productivity, moderating labor costs, and lower inflation have
    helped to improve foreign investor interest in the economy and to
    reduce government borrowing costs. The government's ongoing efforts to
    implement reforms - labor, pension, health, tax, and education - are
    aimed at supporting investor sentiment. The government also has shored
    up struggling banks exposed to Spain's depressed domestic construction
    and real estate sectors by successfully completing an EU-funded
    restructuring and recapitalization program in December 2013.
