Introduction

  Background:
    Britain withdrew from British Somaliland in 1960 to allow its
    protectorate to join with Italian Somaliland and form the new nation of
    Somalia. In 1969, a coup headed by Mohamed SIAD Barre ushered in an
    authoritarian socialist rule characterized by the persecution, jailing,
    and torture of political opponents and dissidents. After the regime's
    collapse early in 1991, Somalia descended into turmoil, factional
    fighting, and anarchy. In May 1991, northern clans declared an
    independent Republic of Somaliland that now includes the administrative
    regions of Awdal, Woqooyi Galbeed, Togdheer, Sanaag, and Sool. Although
    not recognized by any government, this entity has maintained a stable
    existence and continues efforts to establish a constitutional
    democracy, including holding municipal, parliamentary, and presidential
    elections. The regions of Bari, Nugaal, and northern Mudug comprise a
    neighboring semi-autonomous state of Puntland, which has been
    self-governing since 1998 but does not aim at independence; it has also
    made strides toward reconstructing a legitimate, representative
    government but has suffered some civil strife. Puntland disputes its
    border with Somaliland as it also claims portions of eastern Sool and
    Sanaag. Beginning in 1993, a two-year UN humanitarian effort (primarily
    in the south) was able to alleviate famine conditions, but when the UN
    withdrew in 1995, having suffered significant casualties, order still
    had not been restored. In 2000, the Somalia National Peace Conference
    (SNPC) held in Djibouti resulted in the formation of an interim
    government, known as the Transitional National Government (TNG). When
    the TNG failed to establish adequate security or governing
    institutions, the Government of Kenya, under the auspices of the
    Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), led a subsequent
    peace process that concluded in October 2004 with the election of
    Abdullahi YUSUF Ahmed as President of a second interim government,
    known as the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) of the Somali
    Republic. The TFG included a 275-member parliamentary body, known as
    the Transitional Federal Parliament (TFP). President YUSUF resigned
    late in 2008 while United Nations-sponsored talks between the TFG and
    the opposition Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS) were
    underway in Djibouti. In January 2009, following the creation of a
    TFG-ARS unity government, Ethiopian military forces, which had entered
    Somalia in December 2006 to support the TFG in the face of advances by
    the opposition Islamic Courts Union (ICU), withdrew from the country.
    The TFP was doubled in size to 550 seats with the addition of 200 ARS
    and 75 civil society members of parliament. The expanded parliament
    elected Sheikh SHARIF Sheikh Ahmed, the former ICU and ARS chairman as
    president in January 2009. The creation of the TFG was based on the
    Transitional Federal Charter (TFC), which outlined a five-year mandate
    leading to the establishment of a new Somali constitution and a
    transition to a representative government following national elections.
    In 2009, the TFP amended the TFC to extend TFG's mandate until 2011 and
    in 2011 Somali principals agreed to institute political transition by
    August 2012. The transition process ended in September 2012 when clan
    elders replaced the TFP by appointing 275 members to a new parliament
    who subsequently elected a new president.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Despite the lack of effective national governance, Somalia maintains an
    informal economy largely based on livestock, remittance/money transfer
    companies, and telecommunications. Agriculture is the most important
    sector with livestock normally accounting for about 40% of GDP and more
    than 50% of export earnings. Nomads and semi-pastoralists, who are
    dependent upon livestock for their livelihood, make up a large portion
    of the population. Livestock, hides, fish, charcoal, and bananas are
    Somalia's principal exports, while sugar, sorghum, corn, qat, and
    machined goods are the principal imports. Somalia's small industrial
    sector, based on the processing of agricultural products, has largely
    been looted and the machinery sold as scrap metal. Telecommunication
    firms provide wireless services in most major cities and offer the
    lowest international call rates on the continent. Mogadishu's main
    market offers a variety of goods from food to electronic gadgets.
    Hotels continue to operate and are supported with private-security
    militias. Somalia's government lacks the ability to collect domestic
    revenue, and arrears to the IMF have continued to grow. Somalia's
    capital city - Mogadishu - has witnessed the development of the city's
    first gas stations, supermarkets, and flights between Europe
    (Istanbul-Mogadishu) since the collapse of central authority in 1991.
    This economic growth has yet to expand outside of Mogadishu, and within
    the city, security concerns dominate business. In the absence of a
    formal banking sector, money transfer/remittance services have sprouted
    throughout the country, handling up to $1.6 billion in remittances
    annually, although international concerns over the money transfers into
    Somalia currently threatens these services.

  Transportation - note:
    despite a dramatic drop in the number of attacks in 2012, the
    International Maritime Bureau continues to report the territorial and
    offshore waters in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean as a region of
    significant risk for piracy and armed robbery against ships accounting
    for 25% of all attacks in 2012; 75 vessels, including commercial
    shipping and pleasure craft, were attacked or hijacked both at anchor
    and while underway compared with 237 in 2011; the number of hijackings
    off the coast of Somalia was reduced to 14 in 2012, down from 28 in
    2011; as of April 2013, 77 vessels and 7 hostages were being held for
    ransom by Somali pirates; the presence of several naval task forces in
    the Gulf of Aden and additional anti-piracy measures on the part of
    ship operators, including the use of on-board armed security teams,
    have reduced piracy incidents in that body of water; in response
    Somali-based pirates, using hijacked fishing trawlers as "mother ships"
    to extend their range, shifted operations as far south as the
    Mozambique Channel, eastward to the vicinity of the Maldives, and
    northeastward to the Strait of Hormuz

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    Ethiopian forces invaded southern Somalia and routed Islamist Courts
    from Mogadishu in January 2007; "Somaliland" secessionists provide port
    facilities in Berbera to landlocked Ethiopia and have established
    commercial ties with other regional states; "Puntland" and "Somaliland"
    "governments" seek international support in their secessionist
    aspirations and overlapping border claims; the undemarcated former
    British administrative line has little meaning as a political
    separation to rival clans within Ethiopia's Ogaden and southern
    Somalia's Oromo region; Kenya works hard to prevent the clan and
    militia fighting in Somalia from spreading south across the border,
    which has long been open to nomadic pastoralists
