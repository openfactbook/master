Introduction

  Background:
    The principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia - for centuries under the
    suzerainty of the Turkish Ottoman Empire - secured their autonomy in
    1856; they were de facto linked in 1859 and formally united in 1862
    under the new name of Romania. The country gained recognition of its
    independence in 1878. It joined the Allied Powers in World War I and
    acquired new territories - most notably Transylvania - following the
    conflict. In 1940, Romania allied with the Axis powers and participated
    in the 1941 German invasion of the USSR. Three years later, overrun by
    the Soviets, Romania signed an armistice. The post-war Soviet
    occupation led to the formation of a communist "people's republic" in
    1947 and the abdication of the king. The decades-long rule of dictator
    Nicolae CEAUSESCU, who took power in 1965, and his Securitate police
    state became increasingly oppressive and draconian through the 1980s.
    CEAUSESCU was overthrown and executed in late 1989. Former communists
    dominated the government until 1996 when they were swept from power.
    Romania joined NATO in 2004 and the EU in 2007.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Romania, which joined the EU on 1 January 2007, began the transition
    from Communism in 1989 with a largely obsolete industrial base and a
    pattern of output unsuited to the country's needs. The country emerged
    in 2000 from a punishing three-year recession due to strong demand in
    EU export markets. Domestic consumption and investment fueled strong
    GDP growth, but led to large current account imbalances. Romania's
    macroeconomic gains have only recently started to spur creation of a
    middle class and to address Romania's widespread poverty. Corruption
    and red tape continue to permeate the business environment. As a result
    of the global financial crisis, Romania signed on to a $26 billion
    emergency assistance package from the IMF, the EU, and other
    international lenders. GDP contracted from 2009 to 2011. In March 2011,
    Romania and the IMF/EU/World Bank signed a 24-month precautionary
    stand-by agreement, worth $6.6 billion, to promote fiscal discipline,
    encourage progress on structural reforms, and strengthen financial
    sector stability. In September 2013, the Romanian authorities and the
    IMF/EU agreed to a follow-on stand-by agreement, worth $5.4 billion, to
    continue with reforms, although Bucharest announced that it does not
    intend to draw funds under the agreement. Economic growth accelerated
    in 2013, driven by strong industrial exports and an excellent
    agricultural harvest; in December 2013 inflation dropped to a
    historical low annual rate of 1.6%; and the current account deficit was
    reduced substantially. Yet, progress on structural reforms is uneven
    and the economy still is vulnerable to shocks.
