New Caledonia
=============

(self-governing territory of France)


Introduction

  Background:
    Settled by both Britain and France during the first half of the 19th
    century, the island became a French possession in 1853. It served as a
    penal colony for four decades after 1864. Agitation for independence
    during the 1980s and early 1990s ended in the 1998 Noumea Accord, which
    over a period of 15 to 20 years will transfer an increasing amount of
    governing responsibility from France to New Caledonia. The agreement
    also commits France to conduct a referendum between 2014 and 2018 to
    decide whether New Caledonia should assume full sovereignty and
    independence.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    New Caledonia has about 25% of the world's known nickel reserves. Only
    a small amount of the land is suitable for cultivation, and food
    accounts for about 20% of imports. In addition to nickel, substantial
    financial support from France - equal to more than 15% of GDP - and
    tourism are keys to the health of the economy; during 2009-10, France
    sent more development assistance to New Caledonia than to any of its
    other overseas territories. Substantial new investment in the nickel
    industry, combined with the recovery of global nickel prices, brightens
    the economic outlook for the next several years.
