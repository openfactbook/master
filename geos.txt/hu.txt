Introduction

  Background:
    Hungary became a Christian kingdom in A.D. 1000 and for many centuries
    served as a bulwark against Ottoman Turkish expansion in Europe. The
    kingdom eventually became part of the polyglot Austro-Hungarian Empire,
    which collapsed during World War I. The country fell under communist
    rule following World War II. In 1956, a revolt and an announced
    withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact were met with a massive military
    intervention by Moscow. Under the leadership of Janos KADAR in 1968,
    Hungary began liberalizing its economy, introducing so-called "Goulash
    Communism." Hungary held its first multiparty elections in 1990 and
    initiated a free market economy. It joined NATO in 1999 and the EU five
    years later. In 2011, Hungary assumed the six-month rotating presidency
    of the EU for the first time.

    spilled in defense of the land, white for freedom, and green for the
    pasturelands that make up so much of the country

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Hungary has made the transition from a centrally planned to a market
    economy, with a per capita income nearly two-thirds that of the EU-28
    average. In late 2008, Hungary's impending inability to service its
    short-term debt - brought on by the global financial crisis - led
    Budapest to obtain an IMF/EU/World Bank-arranged financial assistance
    package worth over $25 billion. The global economic downturn, declining
    exports, and low domestic consumption and fixed asset accumulation,
    dampened by government austerity measures, resulted in a severe
    economic contraction in 2009. In 2010 the new government implemented a
    number of changes including cutting business and personal income taxes,
    but imposed "crisis taxes" on financial institutions, energy and
    telecom companies, and retailers. The IMF/EU bail-out program lapsed at
    the end of the year and was replaced by Post Program Monitoring and
    Article IV Consultations on overall economic and fiscal processes. At
    the end of 2011 the government turned to the IMF and the EU to obtain
    financial backstop to support its efforts to refinance foreign currency
    debt and bond obligations in 2012 and beyond, but Budapest's rejection
    of EU and IMF economic policy recommendations led to a breakdown in
    talks with the lenders in late 2012. Global demand for high yield has
    since helped Hungary to obtain funds on international markets.
    Hungary’s progress reducing its deficit to under 3% of GDP led the
    European Commission in 2013 to permit Hungary for the first time since
    joining the EU in 2004 to exit the Excessive Deficit Procedure.

    note: Hungary has been under the EU Excessive Deficit Procedure since
    it joined the EU in 2004; in March 2012 the EU elevated its Excessive
    Deficit Procedure against Hungary and proposed freezing 30% of the
    country's Cohesion Funds because 2011 deficit reductions were not
    achieved in a sustainable manner; in June 2012, the EU lifted the
    freeze, recognizing that steps had been taken to reduce the deficit;
    the latest EC forecasts project the Hungarian deficit to increase above
    3% both in 2013 and in 2014 due to sluggish growth and the government's
    fiscal tightening (2013 est.)
