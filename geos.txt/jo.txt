Introduction

  Background:
    Following World War I and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the
    League of Nations awarded Britain the mandate to govern much of the
    Middle East. Britain demarcated a semi-autonomous region of Transjordan
    from Palestine in the early 1920s. The area gained its independence in
    1946 and thereafter became The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The
    country's long-time ruler, King HUSSEIN (1953-99), successfully
    navigated competing pressures from the major powers (US, USSR, and UK),
    various Arab states, Israel, and a large internal Palestinian
    population. Jordan lost the West Bank to Israel in the 1967 Six-Day
    War. King HUSSEIN in 1988 permanently relinquished Jordanian claims to
    the West Bank; in 1994 he signed a peace treaty with Israel. King
    ABDALLAH II, King HUSSEIN's eldest son, assumed the throne following
    his father's death in 1999. He implemented modest political and
    economic reforms, but in the wake of the "Arab Revolution" across the
    Middle East, Jordanians continue to press for further political
    liberalization, government reforms, and economic improvements. In
    January 2014, Jordan assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security
    Council for the 2014-15 term.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Jordan's economy is among the smallest in the Middle East, with
    insufficient supplies of water, oil, and other natural resources
    underlying the government's heavy reliance on foreign assistance. Other
    economic challenges for the government include chronic high rates of
    poverty, unemployment, inflation, and a large budget deficit. Since
    assuming the throne in 1999, King ABDALLAH has implemented significant
    economic reforms, such as opening the trade regime, privatizing
    state-owned companies, and eliminating some fuel subsidies, which in
    the last decade spurred economic growth by attracting foreign
    investment and creating some jobs. The global economic slowdown and
    regional turmoil, however, have depressed Jordan's GDP growth,
    impacting export-oriented sectors, construction, and tourism. In 2011
    and 2012, the government approved two economic relief packages and a
    budgetary supplement, meant to improve the living conditions for the
    middle and poor classes. Jordan's finances have also been strained by a
    series of natural gas pipeline attacks in Egypt, causing Jordan to
    substitute more expensive diesel imports, primarily from Saudi Arabia,
    to generate electricity. Jordan is currently exploring nuclear power
    generation in addition to the exploitation of abundant oil shale
    reserves and renewable technologies to forestall energy shortfalls. In
    2012, to correct budgetary and balance of payments imbalances, Jordan
    entered into a $2.1 billion, multiple year International Monetary Fund
    Stand-By Arrangement. Jordan's financial sector has been relatively
    isolated from the international financial crisis because of its limited
    exposure to overseas capital markets. In 2013, Jordan depended heavily
    on foreign assistance to finance the budget deficit, as the influx of
    about 600,000 Syrian refugees put additional pressure on expenditures.
