Introduction

  Background:
    Finland was a province and then a grand duchy under Sweden from the
    12th to the 19th centuries, and an autonomous grand duchy of Russia
    after 1809. It gained complete independence in 1917. During World War
    II, it successfully defended its independence through cooperation with
    Germany and resisted subsequent invasions by the Soviet Union - albeit
    with some loss of territory. In the subsequent half century, Finland
    transformed from a farm/forest economy to a diversified modern
    industrial economy; per capita income is among the highest in Western
    Europe. A member of the European Union since 1995, Finland was the only
    Nordic state to join the euro single currency at its initiation in
    January 1999. In the 21st century, the key features of Finland's modern
    welfare state are high quality education, promotion of equality, and a
    national social welfare system - currently challenged by an aging
    population and the fluctuations of an export-driven economy.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Finland has a highly industrialized, largely free-market economy with
    per capita output almost as high as that of Austria, Belgium, the
    Netherlands, or Sweden. Trade is important, with exports accounting for
    over one-third of GDP in recent years. Finland is historically
    competitive in manufacturing - principally the wood, metals,
    engineering, telecommunications, and electronics industries. Finland
    excels in export of technology for mobile phones as well as promotion
    of startups in the ICT, gaming, cleantech, and biotechnology sectors.
    Except for timber and several minerals, Finland depends on imports of
    raw materials, energy, and some components for manufactured goods.
    Because of the climate, agricultural development is limited to
    maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products. Forestry, an important
    export earner, provides a secondary occupation for the rural
    population. Finland had been one of the best performing economies
    within the EU in recent years and its banks and financial markets
    avoided the worst of global financial crisis. However, the world
    slowdown hit exports and domestic demand hard in 2009, with Finland
    experiencing one of the deepest contractions in the euro zone. A
    recovery of exports, domestic trade, and household consumption
    stimulated economic growth in 2010-11, however, continued recession
    within the EU dampened the economy in 2012-13. The recession affected
    general government finances and the debt ratio, turning previously
    strong budget surpluses into deficits, but Finland took action to
    ensure it that it met the EU deficit targets in 2013 and retained its
    triple-A credit rating. Finland's main challenge will be to stimulate
    growth while faced with weak export demand in the EU and its own
    government austerity measures. Longer-term, Finland must address a
    rapidly aging population and decreasing productivity in traditional
    industries that threaten competitiveness, fiscal sustainability, and
    economic growth.
