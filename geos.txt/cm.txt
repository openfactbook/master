Cameroon
========


Introduction

  Background:
    French Cameroon became independent in 1960 as the Republic of Cameroon.
    The following year the southern portion of neighboring British Cameroon
    voted to merge with the new country to form the Federal Republic of
    Cameroon. In 1972, a new constitution replaced the federation with a
    unitary state, the United Republic of Cameroon. The country has
    generally enjoyed stability, which has permitted the development of
    agriculture, roads, and railways, as well as a petroleum industry.
    Despite slow movement toward democratic reform, political power remains
    firmly in the hands of President Paul BIYA.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Because of its modest oil resources and favorable agricultural
    conditions, Cameroon has one of the best-endowed primary commodity
    economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Still, it faces many of the serious
    problems confronting other underdeveloped countries, such as stagnant
    per capita income, a relatively inequitable distribution of income, a
    top-heavy civil service, endemic corruption, and a generally
    unfavorable climate for business enterprise. Since 1990, the government
    has embarked on various IMF and World Bank programs designed to spur
    business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, improve trade,
    and recapitalize the nation's banks. The IMF is pressing for more
    reforms, including increased budget transparency, privatization, and
    poverty reduction programs. Subsidies for electricity, food, and fuel
    have strained the budget. Cameroon has several large infrastructure
    projects under construction, including a deep sea port in Kribi and the
    Lom Pangar Hydropower Project. It also recently opened a natural gas
    powered electricity generating plant. Cameroon must attract more
    investment to improve its inadequate infrastructure, but its business
    environment is a deterrent to foreign investment.

    general assessment: system includes cable, microwave radio relay, and
    tropospheric scatter; Camtel, the monopoly provider of fixed-line
    service, provides connections for only about 3 per 100 persons;
    equipment is old and outdated, and connections with many parts of the
    country are unreliable
    domestic: mobile-cellular usage, in part a reflection of the poor
    condition and general inadequacy of the fixed-line network, has
    increased sharply, reaching a subscribership base of 50 per 100 persons
    international: country code - 237; landing point for the SAT-3/WASC

    licenses to 2 private TV broadcasters and 1 private radio broadcaster;
