Samoa

Introduction

  Background:
    New Zealand occupied the German protectorate of Western Samoa at the
    outbreak of World War I in 1914. It continued to administer the islands
    as a mandate and then as a trust territory until 1962, when the islands
    became the first Polynesian nation to reestablish independence in the
    20th century. The country dropped the "Western" from its name in 1997.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    The economy of Samoa has traditionally been dependent on development
    aid, family remittances from overseas, agriculture, and fishing. The
    country is vulnerable to devastating storms. Agriculture employs
    roughly two-thirds of the labor force and furnishes 90% of exports,
    featuring coconut cream, coconut oil, and copra. The manufacturing
    sector mainly processes agricultural products. One factory in the
    Foreign Trade Zone employs 3,000 people to make automobile electrical
    harnesses for an assembly plant in Australia. Tourism is an expanding
    sector accounting for 25% of GDP; 122,000 tourists visited the islands
    in 2007. In late September 2009, an earthquake and the resulting
    tsunami severely damaged Samoa, and nearby American Samoa, disrupting
    transportation and power generation, and resulting in about 200 deaths.
    In December 2012, extensive flooding and wind damage from Tropical
    Cyclone Evan killed four people, displaced over 6,000, and damaged or
    destroyed an estimated 1,500 homes in Samoa's Upolu island. The Samoan
    Government has called for deregulation of the financial sector,
    encouragement of investment, and continued fiscal discipline, while at
    the same time protecting the environment. Observers point to the
    flexibility of the labor market as a basic strength for future economic
    advances. Foreign reserves are in a relatively healthy state, the
    external debt is stable, and inflation is low.
