Introduction

  Background:
    Ukraine was the center of the first eastern Slavic state, Kyivan Rus,
    which during the 10th and 11th centuries was the largest and most
    powerful state in Europe. Weakened by internecine quarrels and Mongol
    invasions, Kyivan Rus was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of
    Lithuania and eventually into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The
    cultural and religious legacy of Kyivan Rus laid the foundation for
    Ukrainian nationalism through subsequent centuries. A new Ukrainian
    state, the Cossack Hetmanate, was established during the mid-17th
    century after an uprising against the Poles. Despite continuous
    Muscovite pressure, the Hetmanate managed to remain autonomous for well
    over 100 years. During the latter part of the 18th century, most
    Ukrainian ethnographic territory was absorbed by the Russian Empire.
    Following the collapse of czarist Russia in 1917, Ukraine was able to
    achieve a short-lived period of independence (1917-20), but was
    reconquered and forced to endure a brutal Soviet rule that engineered
    two forced famines (1921-22 and 1932-33) in which over 8 million died.
    In World War II, German and Soviet armies were responsible for some 7
    to 8 million more deaths. Although final independence for Ukraine was
    achieved in 1991 with the dissolution of the USSR, democracy and
    prosperity remained elusive as the legacy of state control and endemic
    corruption stalled efforts at economic reform, privatization, and civil
    liberties. A peaceful mass protest "Orange Revolution" in the closing
    months of 2004 forced the authorities to overturn a rigged presidential
    election and to allow a new internationally monitored vote that swept
    into power a reformist slate under Viktor YUSHCHENKO. Subsequent
    internal squabbles in the YUSHCHENKO camp allowed his rival Viktor
    YANUKOVYCH to stage a comeback in parliamentary (Rada) elections and to
    become prime minister in August of 2006, and to be elected president in
    February 2010. In October 2012, Ukraine held Rada elections, widely
    criticized by Western observers as flawed due to use of government
    resources to favor ruling party candidates, interference with media
    access, and harassment of opposition candidates. President YANUKOVYCH's
    backtracking on a trade and cooperation agreement with the EU in
    November 2013 - in favor of closer economic ties with Russia - led to a
    three-month protest occupation of Kyiv's central square. The
    government's eventual use of force to break up the protest camp in
    February 2014 led to all out pitched battles, scores of deaths,
    international condemnation, and the president's abrupt departure to
    Russia. An interim government scheduled new presidential elections for
    25 May 2014. On 1 March 2014, one week after the overthrow in Kyiv,
    Russian President PUTIN ordered the invasion of Ukraine's Crimean
    Peninsula claiming the action was to protect ethnic Russians living
    there. On 16 March 2014, a "referendum" was held regarding the
    integration of Crimea into the Russian Federation. The "referendum" was
    condemned as illegitimate by the Ukrainian Government, the EU, the US,
    and the UN General Assembly. Russian forces now occupy Crimea and
    Russian authorities claim it as Russian territory. The Ukrainian
    Government asserts that Crimea remains part of Ukraine.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    After Russia, the Ukrainian republic was the most important economic
    component of the former Soviet Union, producing about four times the
    output of the next-ranking republic. Its fertile black soil generated
    more than one-fourth of Soviet agricultural output, and its farms
    provided substantial quantities of meat, milk, grain, and vegetables to
    other republics. Likewise, its diversified heavy industry supplied the
    unique equipment (for example, large diameter pipes) and raw materials
    to industrial and mining sites (vertical drilling apparatus) in other
    regions of the former USSR. Shortly after independence in August 1991,
    the Ukrainian Government liberalized most prices and erected a legal
    framework for privatization, but widespread resistance to reform within
    the government and the legislature soon stalled reform efforts and led
    to some backtracking. Output by 1999 had fallen to less than 40% of the
    1991 level. Ukraine's dependence on Russia for energy supplies and the
    lack of significant structural reform have made the Ukrainian economy
    vulnerable to external shocks. Ukraine depends on imports to meet about
    three-fourths of its annual oil and natural gas requirements and 100%
    of its nuclear fuel needs. After a two-week dispute that saw gas
    supplies cutoff to Europe, Ukraine agreed to 10-year gas supply and
    transit contracts with Russia in January 2009 that brought gas prices
    to "world" levels. The strict terms of the contracts have further
    hobbled Ukraine's cash-strapped state gas company, Naftohaz. Outside
    institutions - particularly the IMF - have encouraged Ukraine to
    quicken the pace and scope of reforms to foster economic growth.
    Ukrainian Government officials eliminated most tax and customs
    privileges in a March 2005 budget law, bringing more economic activity
    out of Ukraine's large shadow economy, but more improvements are
    needed, including fighting corruption, developing capital markets, and
    improving the legislative framework. Ukraine's economy was buoyant
    despite political turmoil between the prime minister and president
    until mid-2008. The economy contracted nearly 15% in 2009, among the
    worst economic performances in the world. In April 2010, Ukraine
    negotiated a price discount on Russian gas imports in exchange for
    extending Russia's lease on its naval base in Crimea. Movement toward
    an Association Agreement with the European Union, which would commit
    Ukraine to economic and financial reforms in exchange for preferential
    access to EU markets, was curtailed by the November 2013 decision of
    President YANUKOVYCH against signing this treaty. In response, on 17
    December 2013 President YANUKOVYCH and President PUTIN concluded a
    financial assistance package containing $15 billion in loans and lower
    gas prices. However, the end of the YANUKOVYCH government in February
    2014 caused Russia to halt further funding. With the formation of an
    interim government in late February 2014, the international community
    began efforts to stabilize the Ukrainian economy, including a 27 March
    2014 IMF assistance package of $14-18 billion.

Communications

  Telephones - main lines in use:
    12.182 million (2012)

  Telephones - mobile cellular:
    59.344 million (2012)

  Telephone system:
    general assessment: Ukraine's telecommunication development plan
    emphasizes improving domestic trunk lines, international connections,
    and the mobile-cellular system
    domestic: at independence in December 1991, Ukraine inherited a
    telephone system that was antiquated, inefficient, and in disrepair;
    more than 3.5 million applications for telephones could not be
    satisfied; telephone density is rising and the domestic trunk system is
    being improved; about one-third of Ukraine's networks are digital and a
    majority of regional centers now have digital switching stations;
    improvements in local networks and local exchanges continue to lag; the
    mobile-cellular telephone system's expansion has slowed, largely due to
    saturation of the market which has reached 125 mobile phones per 100
    people
    international: country code - 380; 2 new domestic trunk lines are a
    part of the fiber-optic Trans-Asia-Europe (TAE) system and 3 Ukrainian
    links have been installed in the fiber-optic Trans-European Lines (TEL)
    project that connects 18 countries; additional international service is
    provided by the Italy-Turkey-Ukraine-Russia (ITUR) fiber-optic
    submarine cable and by an unknown number of earth stations in the
    Intelsat, Inmarsat, and Intersputnik satellite systems (2010)

  Broadcast media:
    Ukraine's state-controlled nationwide TV broadcast channel (UT1) and a
    number of privately owned TV networks provide basic TV coverage;
    multi-channel cable and satellite TV services are available; Russian
    television broadcasts have a small audience nationwide, but larger
    audiences in the eastern and southern regions; Ukraine's radio
    broadcast market, a mix of independent and state-owned networks, is
    comprised of some 300 stations (2007)

  Internet country code:
    .ua

  Internet hosts:
    2.173 million (2012)

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    1997 boundary delimitation treaty with Belarus remains unratified due
    to unresolved financial claims, stalling demarcation and reducing
    border security; delimitation of land boundary with Russia is complete
    with preparations for demarcation underway; the dispute over the
    boundary between Russia and Ukraine through the Kerch Strait and Sea of
    Azov is suspended due to the occupation of Crimea by Russia; Moldova
    and Ukraine operate joint customs posts to monitor transit of people
    and commodities through Moldova's break-away Transnistria Region, which
    remains under the auspices of an Organization for Security and
    Cooperation in Europe-mandated peacekeeping mission comprised of
    Moldovan, Transnistrian, Russian, and Ukrainian troops; the ICJ ruled
    largely in favor of Romania in its dispute submitted in 2004 over
    Ukrainian-administered Zmiyinyy/Serpilor (Snake) Island and Black Sea
    maritime boundary delimitation; Romania opposes Ukraine's reopening of
    a navigation canal from the Danube border through Ukraine to the Black
    Sea

  Refugees and internally displaced persons:
    IDPs: 10,000 (separatist violence in Crimea and eastern Ukraine) (2014)
    stateless persons: 35,000 (2012); note - citizens of the former USSR
    who were permanently resident in Ukraine were granted citizenship upon
    Ukraine's independence in 1991, but some missed this window of
    opportunity; people arriving after 1991, Crimean Tatars, ethnic
    Koreans, people with expired Soviet passports, and people with no
    documents have difficulty acquiring Ukrainian citizenship; following
    the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989, thousands of Crimean Tatars and
    their descendants deported from Ukraine under the STALIN regime
    returned to their homeland, some being stateless and others holding the
    citizenship of Uzbekistan or other former Soviet republics; a 1998
    bilateral agreement between Ukraine and Uzbekistan simplified the
    process of renouncing Uzbek citizenship and obtaining Ukrainian
    citizenship

  Trafficking in persons:
    current situation: Ukraine is a source, transit, and, increasingly,
    destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced
    labor and sex trafficking; Ukrainian victims are sex trafficked within
    Ukraine as well as in Russia, Poland, Iraq, Spain, Turkey, Cyprus,
    Seychelles, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Israel, Italy, the United
    Arab Emirates, Montenegro, UK, and Tunisia; foreigners from Moldova,
    Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Cameroon, and Azerbaijan are victims of labor
    trafficking in Ukraine; Ukrainian recruiters most often target
    Ukrainians from rural areas with limited job prospects by using fraud,
    coercion, and debt bondage
    tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Ukraine does not fully comply with the
    minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is
    making significant efforts to do so; the government reduced its
    anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts in 2012; as a result of the
    dismantling of the specialized anti-trafficking police unit in 2011,
    the number of trafficking investigations, prosecutions, and convictions
    have decreased; fewer victims are identified and the national referral
    mechanism does not function effectively in many regions, resulting in
    few victims being granted victim status by the government; the
    government did not fund any anti-trafficking protection activities in
    2012 and continues to rely on international donors to assist victims
    (2013)

  Illicit drugs:
    limited cultivation of cannabis and opium poppy, mostly for CIS
    consumption; some synthetic drug production for export to the West;
    limited government eradication program; used as transshipment point for
    opiates and other illicit drugs from Africa, Latin America, and Turkey
    to Europe and Russia; Ukraine has improved anti-money-laundering
    controls, resulting in its removal from the Financial Action Task
    Force's (FATF's) Noncooperative Countries and Territories List in
    February 2004; Ukraine's anti-money-laundering regime continues to be
    monitored by FATF
