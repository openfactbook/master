Introduction

  Background:
    The region of present day Georgia contained the ancient kingdoms of
    Colchis and Kartli-Iberia. The area came under Roman influence in the
    first centuries A.D., and Christianity became the state religion in the
    330s. Domination by Persians, Arabs, and Turks was followed by a
    Georgian golden age (11th-13th centuries) that was cut short by the
    Mongol invasion of 1236. Subsequently, the Ottoman and Persian empires
    competed for influence in the region. Georgia was absorbed into the
    Russian Empire in the 19th century. Independent for three years
    (1918-1921) following the Russian revolution, it was forcibly
    incorporated into the USSR in 1921 and regained its independence when
    the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. Mounting public discontent over
    rampant corruption and ineffective government services, followed by an
    attempt by the incumbent Georgian Government to manipulate national
    legislative elections in November 2003 touched off widespread protests
    that led to the resignation of Eduard SHEVARDNADZE, president since
    1995. In the aftermath of that popular movement, which became known as
    the "Rose Revolution," new elections in early 2004 swept Mikheil
    SAAKASHVILI into power along with his United National Movement (UNM)
    party. Progress on market reforms and democratization has been made in
    the years since independence, but this progress has been complicated by
    Russian assistance and support to the separatist regions of Abkhazia
    and South Ossetia. Periodic flare-ups in tension and violence
    culminated in a five-day conflict in August 2008 between Russia and
    Georgia, including the invasion of large portions of undisputed
    Georgian territory. Russian troops pledged to pull back from most
    occupied Georgian territory, but in late August 2008 Russia
    unilaterally recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia,
    and Russian military forces remain in those regions. Billionaire
    philanthropist Bidzina IVANISHVILI's unexpected entry into politics in
    October 2011 brought the divided opposition together under his Georgian
    Dream coalition, which won a majority of seats in the October 2012
    parliamentary election and removed UNM from power. Conceding defeat,
    SAAKASHVILI named IVANISHVILI as prime minister and allowed Georgian
    Dream to create a new government. Georgian Dream's Giorgi
    MARGVELASHVILI was inaugurated as president on 17 November 2013, ending
    a tense year of power-sharing between SAAKASHVILI and IVANISHVILI.
    IVANISHVILI voluntarily resigned from office after the presidential
    succession, and Georgia's legislature on 20 November 2013 confirmed
    Irakli GARIBASHVILI as his replacement. Georgia's recent elections
    represent unique examples of a former Soviet state that emerged to
    conduct democratic and peaceful government transitions of power.
    Popular and government support for integration with the West is high in
    Georgia. Joining the EU and NATO are among the country's top foreign
    policy goals.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Georgia's main economic activities include cultivation of agricultural
    products such as grapes, citrus fruits, and hazelnuts; mining of
    manganese, copper, and gold; and producing alcoholic and nonalcoholic
    beverages, metals, machinery, and chemicals in small-scale industries.
    The country imports nearly all its needed supplies of natural gas and
    oil products. It has sizeable hydropower capacity that now provides
    most of its energy needs. Georgia has overcome the chronic energy
    shortages and gas supply interruptions of the past by renovating
    hydropower plants and by increasingly relying on natural gas imports
    from Azerbaijan instead of from Russia. Construction of the
    Baku-T'bilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, the South Caucasus gas pipeline, and
    the Kars-Akhalkalaki Railroad are part of a strategy to capitalize on
    Georgia's strategic location between Europe and Asia and develop its
    role as a transit point for gas, oil, and other goods. The expansion of
    the South Caucasus pipeline, as part of the Shah Deniz II Southern Gas
    Corridor project, will result in a $2 billion foreign investment in
    Georgia, the largest ever in the country. Gas from Shah Deniz II is
    expected to begin flowing in 2019. Georgia's economy sustained GDP
    growth of more than 10% in 2006-07, based on strong inflows of foreign
    investment and robust government spending. However, GDP growth slowed
    following the August 2008 conflict with Russia, and sunk to negative 4%
    in 2009 as foreign direct investment and workers' remittances declined
    in the wake of the global financial crisis. The economy rebounded in
    2010-13, but FDI inflows, the engine of Georgian economic growth prior
    to the 2008 conflict, have not recovered fully. Unemployment has also
    remained high. Georgia has historically suffered from a chronic failure
    to collect tax revenues; however, since 2004 the government has
    simplified the tax code, improved tax administration, increased tax
    enforcement, and cracked down on petty corruption, leading to higher
    revenues. The country is pinning its hopes for renewed growth on a
    determined effort to continue to liberalize the economy by reducing
    regulation, taxes, and corruption in order to attract foreign
    investment, with a focus on hydropower, agriculture, tourism, and
    textiles production. The government has received high marks from the
    World Bank for its anti-corruption efforts. Over the past year the
    Georgian Dream-led government continued the previous administration's
    low-regulation, low-tax, free market policies, while modestly
    increasing social spending, strengthening anti-trust policy, and
    amending the labor code to comply with International Labor Standards.
    The government is finalizing its 2020 Economic Development Strategy and
    has launched the Georgia Co-Investment Fund, a $6 billion private
    equity fund that will invest in tourism, agriculture, logistics,
    energy, infrastructure, and manufacturing.
