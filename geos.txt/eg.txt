Introduction

  Background:
    The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood, coupled
    with semi-isolation provided by deserts to the east and west, allowed
    for the development of one of the world's great civilizations. A
    unified kingdom arose circa 3200 B.C., and a series of dynasties ruled
    in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last native dynasty fell to
    the Persians in 341 B.C., who in turn were replaced by the Greeks,
    Romans, and Byzantines. It was the Arabs who introduced Islam and the
    Arabic language in the 7th century and who ruled for the next six
    centuries. A local military caste, the Mamluks took control about 1250
    and continued to govern after the conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman
    Turks in 1517. Completion of the Suez Canal in 1869 elevated Egypt as
    an important world transportation hub. Ostensibly to protect its
    investments, Britain seized control of Egypt's government in 1882, but
    nominal allegiance to the Ottoman Empire continued until 1914.
    Partially independent from the UK in 1922, Egypt acquired full
    sovereignty from Britain in 1952. The completion of the Aswan High Dam
    in 1971 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the time-honored
    place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A
    rapidly growing population (the largest in the Arab world), limited
    arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax
    resources and stress society. The government has struggled to meet the
    demands of Egypt's population through economic reform and massive
    investment in communications and physical infrastructure. Inspired by
    the 2010 Tunisian revolution, Egyptian opposition groups led
    demonstrations and labor strikes countrywide, culminating in President
    Hosni MUBARAK's ouster. Egypt's military assumed national leadership
    until a new parliament was in place in early 2012; later that same
    year, Mohammed MORSI won the presidential election. Following often
    violent protests throughout the spring of 2013 against MORSI's
    government and the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), and massive anti-government
    demonstrations, the Egyptian Armed Forces (EAF) intervened and removed
    MORSI from power in mid-July 2013 and replaced him with interim
    president Adly MANSOUR. In mid-January 2014, voters approved a new
    constitution by referendum. Presidential elections to replace MANSOUR
    are scheduled for late May 2014. According to the constitution and the
    government's transitional road map, preparations for parliamentary
    elections will begin by mid-July 2014.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Occupying the northeast corner of the African continent, Egypt is
    bisected by the highly fertile Nile valley, where most economic
    activity takes place. Egypt's economy was highly centralized during the
    rule of former President Gamal Abdel NASSER but opened up considerably
    under former Presidents Anwar EL-SADAT and Mohamed Hosni MUBARAK. Cairo
    from 2004 to 2008 aggressively pursued economic reforms to attract
    foreign investment and facilitate growth. Poor living conditions
    combined with limited job opportunities for the average Egyptian
    contribute to public discontent. After unrest erupted in January 2011,
    the Egyptian Government backtracked on economic reforms, drastically
    increasing social spending to address public dissatisfaction, but
    political uncertainty at the same time caused economic growth to slow
    significantly, reducing the government's revenues. Tourism,
    manufacturing, and construction were among the hardest hit sectors of
    the Egyptian economy, pushing up unemployment levels, and economic
    growth remains slow amid political uncertainty, government transitions,
    unrest, and cycles of violence. Cairo since 2011 has drawn down foreign
    exchange reserves and depended on foreign assistance, particularly from
    Gulf countries, to finance imports and energy products and prevent
    further devaluation of the Egyptian pound, fearing higher inflation
    from a weaker currency.
