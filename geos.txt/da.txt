Introduction

  Background:
    Once the seat of Viking raiders and later a major north European power,
    Denmark has evolved into a modern, prosperous nation that is
    participating in the general political and economic integration of
    Europe. It joined NATO in 1949 and the EEC (now the EU) in 1973.
    However, the country has opted out of certain elements of the European
    Union's Maastricht Treaty, including the European Economic and Monetary
    Union (EMU), European defense cooperation, and issues concerning
    certain justice and home affairs.

  Flag description:
    red with a white cross that extends to the edges of the flag; the
    vertical part of the cross is shifted to the hoist side; the banner is
    referred to as the Dannebrog (Danish flag) and is one of the oldest
    national flags in the world; traditions as to the origin of the flag
    design vary, but the best known is a legend that the banner fell from
    the sky during an early-13th century battle; caught up by the Danish
    king before it ever touched the earth, this heavenly talisman inspired
    the royal army to victory; in actuality, the flag may derive from a
    crusade banner or ensign
    note: the shifted design element was subsequently adopted by the other
    Nordic countries of Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden

  National symbol(s):
    lion; mute swan

  National anthem:
    name: "Der er et yndigt land" (There is a Lovely Land); "Kong
    Christian" (King Christian)
    lyrics/music: Adam Gottlob OEHLENSCHLAGER/Hans Ernst KROYER; Johannes
    EWALD/unknown
    note: Denmark has two national anthems with equal status; "Der er et
    yndigt land," adopted 1844, is a national anthem, while "Kong
    Christian," adopted 1780, serves as both a national and royal anthem;
    "Kong Christian" is also known as "Kong Christian stod ved hojen mast"
    (King Christian Stood by the Lofty Mast) and "Kongesangen" (The King's
    Anthem); within Denmark, the royal anthem is played only when royalty
    is present and is usually followed by the national anthem; when royalty
    is not present, only the national anthem is performed; outside Denmark,
    the royal anthem is played, unless the national anthem is requested


Economy

  Economy - overview:
    This thoroughly modern market economy features a high-tech agricultural
    sector, state-of-the-art industry with world-leading firms in
    pharmaceuticals, maritime shipping and renewable energy, and a high
    dependence on foreign trade. Denmark is a member of the European Union
    (EU); Danish legislation and regulations conform to EU standards on
    almost all issues. Danes enjoy a high standard of living and the Danish
    economy is characterized by extensive government welfare measures and
    an equitable distribution of income. Denmark is a net exporter of food
    and energy and enjoys a comfortable balance of payments surplus, but
    depends on imports of raw materials for the manufacturing sector.
    Within the EU, Denmark is among the strongest supporters of trade
    liberalization. After a long consumption-driven upswing, Denmark's
    economy began slowing in 2007 with the end of a housing boom. Housing
    prices dropped markedly in 2008-09 and, following a short respite in
    2010, have since continued to decline. Household indebtedness is still
    relatively high at more than 275% of gross disposable income in the
    first half of 2013. The global financial crisis has exacerbated this
    cyclical slowdown through increased borrowing costs and lower export
    demand, consumer confidence, and investment. Denmark made a modest
    recovery in 2010, in part because of increased government spending;
    however, the country experienced a technical recession in late
    2010-early 2011. Historically low levels of unemployment rose sharply
    with the recession and have remained at about 6% in 2010-13, based on
    the national measure, about two-thirds average EU unemployment. An
    impending decline in the ratio of workers to retirees will be a major
    long-term issue. Denmark maintained a healthy budget surplus for many
    years up to 2008, but the budget balance swung into deficit in 2009,
    where it remains. In spite of the deficits, the new coalition
    government delivered a modest stimulus to the economy in 2012.
    Nonetheless, Denmark's fiscal position remains among the strongest in
    the EU with public debt at about 46% of GDP in 2013. Despite previously
    meeting the criteria to join the European Economic and Monetary Union
    (EMU), so far Denmark has decided not to join, although the Danish
    krone remains pegged to the euro.
