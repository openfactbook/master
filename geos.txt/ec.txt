Ecuador

Introduction

  Background:
    What is now Ecuador formed part of the northern Inca Empire until the
    Spanish conquest in 1533. Quito became a seat of Spanish colonial
    government in 1563 and part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada in 1717.
    The territories of the Viceroyalty - New Granada (Colombia), Venezuela,
    and Quito - gained their independence between 1819 and 1822 and formed
    a federation known as Gran Colombia. When Quito withdrew in 1830, the
    traditional name was changed in favor of the "Republic of the Equator."
    Between 1904 and 1942, Ecuador lost territories in a series of
    conflicts with its neighbors. A border war with Peru that flared in
    1995 was resolved in 1999. Although Ecuador marked 30 years of civilian
    governance in 2004, the period was marred by political instability.
    Protests in Quito contributed to the mid-term ouster of three of
    Ecuador's last four democratically elected presidents. In late 2008,
    voters approved a new constitution, Ecuador's 20th since gaining
    independence. General elections were held in February 2013, and voters
    re-elected President Rafael CORREA.

People and Society

  Nationality:
    noun: Ecuadorian(s)
    adjective: Ecuadorian

  Ethnic groups:
    mestizo (mixed Amerindian and white) 71.9%, Montubio 7.4%,
    Afroecuadorian 7.2%, Amerindian 7%, white 6.1%, other 0.4% (2010
    census)

  Languages:
    Spanish (Castillian) 93% (official), Quechua 4.1%, other indigenous
    0.7%, foreign 2.2%
    note: (Quechua and Shuar are official languages of intercultural
    relations; other indigenous languages are in official use by indigenous
    peoples in the areas they inhabit) (2010 est.)

  Religions:
    Roman Catholic 95%, other 5%

  Demographic profile:
    Ecuador's high poverty and income inequality most affect indigenous,
    mixed race, and rural populations. The government has increased its
    social spending to ameliorate these problems, but critics question the
    efficiency and implementation of its national development plan.
    Nevertheless, the conditional cash transfer program, which requires
    participants' children to attend school and have medical check-ups, has
    helped improve educational attainment and healthcare among poor
    children. Ecuador is stalled at above replacement level fertility and
    the population most likely will keep growing rather than stabilize.
    An estimated 2 to 3 million Ecuadorians live abroad, but increased
    unemployment in key receiving countries - Spain, the United States, and
    Italy - is slowing emigration and increasing the likelihood of
    returnees to Ecuador. The first large-scale emigration of Ecuadorians
    occurred between 1980 and 2000, when an economic crisis drove
    Ecuadorians from southern provinces to New York City, where they had
    trade contacts. A second, nationwide wave of emigration in the late
    1990s was caused by another economic downturn, political instability,
    and a currency crisis. Spain was the logical destination because of its
    shared language and the wide availability of low-skilled, informal jobs
    at a time when increased border surveillance made illegal migration to
    the US difficult. Ecuador has a small but growing immigrant population
    and is Latin America's top recipient of refugees; 98% are neighboring
    Colombians fleeing violence in their country.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Ecuador is substantially dependent on its petroleum resources, which
    have accounted for more than half of the country's export earnings and
    approximately two-fifths of public sector revenues in recent years. In
    1999/2000, Ecuador's economy suffered from a banking crisis, with GDP
    contracting by 5.3% and poverty increasing significantly. In March
    2000, the Congress approved a series of structural reforms that also
    provided for the adoption of the US dollar as legal tender.
    Dollarization stabilized the economy, and positive growth returned in
    the years that followed, helped by high oil prices, remittances, and
    increased non-traditional exports. From 2002-06 the economy grew an
    average of 4.3% per year, the highest five-year average in 25 years.
    After moderate growth in 2007, the economy reached a growth rate of
    6.4% in 2008, buoyed by high global petroleum prices and increased
    public sector investment. President Rafael CORREA Delgado, who took
    office in January 2007, defaulted in December 2008 on Ecuador's
    sovereign debt, which, with a total face value of approximately US$3.2
    billion, represented about 30% of Ecuador's public external debt. In
    May 2009, Ecuador bought back 91% of its "defaulted" bonds via an
    international reverse auction. Economic policies under the CORREA
    administration - for example, an announcement in late 2009 of its
    intention to terminate 13 bilateral investment treaties, including one
    with the United States - have generated economic uncertainty and
    discouraged private investment. China has become Ecuador's largest
    foreign lender since Quito defaulted in 2008, allowing the government
    to maintain a high rate of social spending; Ecuador contracted with the
    Chinese government for more than $9.9 billion in forward oil sales,
    project financing, and budget support loans as of December 2013.
    Foreign investment levels in Ecuador continue to be the lowest in the
    region as a result of an unstable regulatory environment, weak rule of
    law, and the crowding-out effect of public investments. In 2013, oil
    output marginally reversed a declining trend and production is expected
    to increase slightly in 2014, although prices will likely remain lower
    than in previous years. Faced with a 2013 trade deficit of $1.1
    billion, Ecuador erected technical barriers to trade in December 2013,
    causing tensions with its largest trading partners. Ecuador also
    decriminalized intellectual property rights violations in February
    2014.
