==========


Introduction

  Background:
    A lengthy struggle between France and Great Britain for the islands
    ended in 1814, when they were ceded to the latter. Independence came in
    1976. Socialist rule was brought to a close with a new constitution and
    free elections in 1993. President France-Albert RENE, who had served
    since 1977, was re-elected in 2001, but stepped down in 2004. Vice
    President James Alix MICHEL took over the presidency and in July 2006
    was elected to a new five-year term; he was reelected in May 2011.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Since independence in 1976, per capita output in this Indian Ocean
    archipelago has expanded to roughly seven times the pre-independence,
    near-subsistence level, moving the island into the upper-middle-income
    group of countries. Growth has been led by the tourist sector, which
    employs about 30% of the labor force and provides more than 70% of hard
    currency earnings, and by tuna fishing. In recent years, the government
    has encouraged foreign investment to upgrade hotels and other services.
    At the same time, the government has moved to reduce the dependence on
    tourism by promoting the development of farming, fishing, and
    small-scale manufacturing. In 2008, having depleted its foreign
    exchange reserves, Seychelles defaulted on interest payments due on a
    $230 million Eurobond, requested assistance from the International
    Monetary Fund (IMF), and immediately enacted a number of significant
    structural reforms, including liberalization of the exchange rate,
    reform of the public sector to include layoffs, and the selling of some
    state assets. In December 2013, the IMF declared that Seychelles had
    successfully transitioned to a market-based economy with full
    employment and a fiscal surplus.
