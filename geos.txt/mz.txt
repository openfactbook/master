Mozambique
==========


Introduction

  Background:
    Almost five centuries as a Portuguese colony came to a close with
    independence in 1975. Large-scale emigration, economic dependence on
    South Africa, a severe drought, and a prolonged civil war hindered the
    country's development until the mid 1990s. The ruling Front for the
    Liberation of Mozambique (Frelimo) party formally abandoned Marxism in
    1989, and a new constitution the following year provided for multiparty
    elections and a free market economy. A UN-negotiated peace agreement
    between Frelimo and rebel Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo)
    forces ended the fighting in 1992. In December 2004, Mozambique
    underwent a delicate transition as Joaquim CHISSANO stepped down after
    18 years in office. His elected successor, Armando Emilio GUEBUZA,
    promised to continue the sound economic policies that have encouraged
    foreign investment. President GUEBUZA was reelected to a second term in
    October 2009. However, the elections were flawed by voter fraud,
    questionable disqualification of candidates, and Frelimo use of
    government resources during the campaign. As a result, Freedom House
    removed Mozambique from its list of electoral democracies.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    At independence in 1975, Mozambique was one of the world's poorest
    countries. Socialist mismanagement and a brutal civil war from 1977-92
    exacerbated the situation. In 1987, the government embarked on a series
    of macroeconomic reforms designed to stabilize the economy. These
    steps, combined with donor assistance and with political stability
    since the multi-party elections in 1994, have led to dramatic
    improvements in the country's growth rate. Fiscal reforms, including
    the introduction of a value-added tax and reform of the customs
    service, have improved the government's revenue collection abilities.
    In spite of these gains, Mozambique remained dependent upon foreign
    assistance for 40% of its 2012 annual budget and over half the
    population remained below the poverty line. Subsistence agriculture
    continues to employ the vast majority of the country's work force and
    smallholder agricultural productivity and productivity growth is weak.
    A substantial trade imbalance persists although aluminum production
    from the Mozal smelter has significantly boosted export earnings in
    recent years. In 2012, The Mozambican government took over Portugal's
    last remaining share in the Cahora Bassa Hydroelectricity Company
    (HCB), a signficant contributor to the Southern African Power Pool. The
    government has plans to expand the Cahora Bassa Dam and build
    additional dams to increase its electricity exports and fulfill the
    needs of its burgeoning domestic industries. Mozambique's once
    substantial foreign debt has been reduced through forgiveness and
    rescheduling under the IMF's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and
    Enhanced HIPC initiatives, and is now at a manageable level. In July
    2007, the US government's Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) signed
    a $506.9 million Compact with Mozambique. Compact projects will end in
    September 2013 and are focusing on improving sanitation, roads,
    agriculture, and the business regulation environment in an effort to
    spur economic growth in the four northern provinces of the country.
    Citizens rioted in September 2010, after fuel, water, electricity, and
    bread price increases were announced. In an attempt to lessen the
    negative impact on people, the government implemented subsidies,
    decreased taxes and tariffs, and instituted other fiscal measures.
    Mozambique grew at an average annual rate of 6%-8% in the decade up to
    2013, one of Africa's strongest performances. Mozambique's ability to
    attract large investment projects in natural resources is expected to
    fuel continued high growth in coming years. Revenues from these vast
    resources, including natural gas, coal, titanium and hydroelectric
    capacity, could overtake donor assistance within five years.

  Telephone system:
    general assessment: a fair telecommunications system that is shackled
    with a heavy state presence, lack of competition, and high operating
    costs and charges
    domestic: stagnation in the fixed-line network contrasts with rapid
    growth in the mobile-cellular network; mobile-cellular coverage now
    includes all the main cities and key roads, including those from Maputo
    to the South African and Swaziland borders, the national highway
    through Gaza and Inhambane provinces, the Beira corridor, and from
    Nampula to Nacala; extremely low fixed-line teledensity; despite
    significant growth in mobile-cellular services, teledensity remains low
    at about 35 per 100 persons
    international: country code - 258; landing point for the EASSy and
    SEACOM fiber-optic submarine cable systems; satellite earth stations -

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    South Africa has placed military units to assist police operations
    along the border of Lesotho, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique to control
    smuggling, poaching, and illegal migration

  Illicit drugs:
    southern African transit point for South Asian hashish and heroin, and
    South American cocaine probably destined for the European and South
    African markets; producer of cannabis (for local consumption) and
    methaqualone (for export to South Africa); corruption and poor
    regulatory capability make the banking system vulnerable to money
    laundering, but the lack of a well-developed financial infrastructure
    limits the country's utility as a money-laundering center
