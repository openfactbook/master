Azerbaijan
==========


Introduction

  Background:
    Azerbaijan - a nation with a majority-Turkic and majority-Shia Muslim
    population - was briefly independent (from 1918 to 1920) following the
    collapse of the Russian Empire; it was subsequently incorporated into
    the Soviet Union for seven decades. Azerbaijan has yet to resolve its
    conflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh, a primarily
    Armenian-populated region that Moscow recognized in 1923 as an
    autonomous republic within Soviet Azerbaijan after Armenia and
    Azerbaijan disputed the territory's status. Armenia and Azerbaijan
    began fighting over the area in 1988; the struggle escalated after both
    countries attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By May
    1994, when a cease-fire took hold, ethnic Armenian forces held not only
    Nagorno-Karabakh but also seven surrounding provinces in the territory
    of Azerbaijan. The OSCE Minsk Group, co-chaired by the United States,
    France, and Russia, is the framework established to mediate a peaceful
    resolution of the conflict. Corruption in the country is widespread,
    and the government, which eliminated presidential term limits in a 2009
    referendum, has been accused of authoritarianism. Although the poverty
    rate has been reduced and infrastructure investment has increased
    substantially in recent years due to revenue from oil and gas
    production, reforms have not adequately addressed weaknesses in most
    government institutions, particularly in the education and health
    sectors.


Geography

  Location:
    Southwestern Asia, bordering the Caspian Sea, between Iran and Russia,
    with a small European portion north of the Caucasus range

  Geographic coordinates:
    40 30 N, 47 30 E

  Map references:
    Middle East

  Area:
    total: 86,600 sq km
    land: 82,629 sq km
    water: 3,971 sq km
    note: includes the exclave of Naxcivan Autonomous Republic and the
    Nagorno-Karabakh region; the region's autonomy was abolished by
    Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet on 26 November 1991

  Area - comparative:
    slightly smaller than Maine

  Land boundaries:
    total: 2,468 km
    border countries: Armenia 996 km, Georgia 428 km, Iran 689 km, Russia
    338 km, Turkey 17 km

  Coastline:
    0 km (landlocked); note - Azerbaijan borders the Caspian Sea (713 km)

  Maritime claims:
    none (landlocked)

  Climate:
    dry, semiarid steppe

  Terrain:
    large, flat Kur-Araz Ovaligi (Kura-Araks Lowland, much of it below sea
    level) with Great Caucasus Mountains to the north, Qarabag Yaylasi
    (Karabakh Upland) in west; Baku lies on Abseron Yasaqligi (Apsheron
    Peninsula) that juts into Caspian Sea

  Elevation extremes:
    lowest point: Caspian Sea -28 m
    highest point: Bazarduzu Dagi 4,485 m

  Natural resources:
    petroleum, natural gas, iron ore, nonferrous metals, bauxite

  Land use:

  Environment - current issues:
    local scientists consider the Abseron Yasaqligi (Apsheron Peninsula)
    (including Baku and Sumqayit) and the Caspian Sea to be the
    ecologically most devastated area in the world because of severe air,
    soil, and water pollution; soil pollution results from oil spills, from
    the use of DDT pesticide, and from toxic defoliants used in the
    production of cotton

  Environment - international agreements:
    party to: Air Pollution, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate
    Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous
    Wastes, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution,

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Azerbaijan's high economic growth has been attributable to large and
    growing oil and gas exports, but some non-export sectors also featured
    double-digit growth, including construction, banking, and real estate.
    Oil exports through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline, the
    Baku-Novorossiysk, and the Baku-Supsa pipelines remain the main
    economic driver, but efforts to boost Azerbaijan's gas production are
    underway. The eventual completion of the geopolitically important
    Southern Gas Corridor between Azerbaijan and Europe will open up
    another, albeit, smaller source of revenue from gas exports. Azerbaijan
    has made only limited progress on instituting market-based economic
    reforms. Pervasive public and private sector corruption and structural
    economic inefficiencies remain a drag on long-term growth, particularly
    in non-energy sectors. Several other obstacles impede Azerbaijan's
    economic progress, including the need for stepped up foreign investment
    in the non-energy sector and the continuing conflict with Armenia over
    the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Trade with Russia and the other former
    Soviet republics is declining in importance, while trade is building
    with Turkey and the nations of Europe. Long-term prospects depend on
    world oil prices, Azerbaijan's ability to negotiate export routes for
    its growing gas production, and its ability to use its energy wealth to
    promote growth and spur employment in non-energy sectors of the
    economy.

    general assessment: requires considerable expansion and modernization;
    fixed-line telephone and a broad range of other telecom services are
    controlled by a state-owned telecommunications monopoly and growth has
    been stagnant; more competition exists in the mobile-cellular market
    with four providers in 2009

    mobile-cellular teledensity has increased and now exceeds 100
    telephones per 100 persons; satellite service connects Baku to a modern
    switch in its exclave of Naxcivan (Nakhichevan)
    international: country code - 994; the Trans-Asia-Europe (TAE)

    surrounding lands in Azerbaijan remains the primary focus of regional
    instability; residents have evacuated the former Soviet-era small
    ethnic enclaves in Armenia and Azerbaijan; local border forces struggle
