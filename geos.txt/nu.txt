Nicaragua
=========


Introduction

  Background:
    The Pacific coast of Nicaragua was settled as a Spanish colony from
    Panama in the early 16th century. Independence from Spain was declared
    in 1821 and the country became an independent republic in 1838. Britain
    occupied the Caribbean Coast in the first half of the 19th century, but
    gradually ceded control of the region in subsequent decades. Violent
    opposition to governmental manipulation and corruption spread to all
    classes by 1978 and resulted in a short-lived civil war that brought
    the Marxist Sandinista guerrillas to power in 1979. Nicaraguan aid to
    leftist rebels in El Salvador caused the US to sponsor anti-Sandinista
    contra guerrillas through much of the 1980s. After losing free and fair
    elections in 1990, 1996, and 2001, former Sandinista President Daniel
    ORTEGA Saavedra was elected president in 2006 and reelected in 2011.
    The 2008 municipal elections, 2010 regional elections, 2011
    presidential elections, 2012 municipal elections, and 2013 regional
    elections were marred by widespread irregularities. Nicaragua's
    infrastructure and economy - hard hit by the earlier civil war and by
    Hurricane Mitch in 1998 - are slowly being rebuilt, but democratic
    institutions have been weakened under the ORTEGA administration.

People and Society

  Nationality:
    noun: Nicaraguan(s)
    adjective: Nicaraguan

  Ethnic groups:
    mestizo (mixed Amerindian and white) 69%, white 17%, black 9%,
    Amerindian 5%

  Languages:
    Spanish (official) 95.3%, Miskito 2.2%, Mestizo of the Caribbean coast
    2%, other 0.5%
    note: English and indigenous languages found on the Caribbean coast
    (2005 est.)

  Religions:
    Roman Catholic 58.5%, Protestant 23.2% (Evangelical 21.6%, Moravian
    1.6%), Jehovah's Witnesses 0.9%, other 1.6%, none 15.7% (2005 est.)

  Demographic profile:
    Despite being one of the poorest countries in Latin America, Nicaragua
    has improved its access to potable water and sanitation and has
    ameliorated its life expectancy, infant and child mortality, and
    immunization rates. However, income distribution is very uneven, and
    the poor, agriculturalists, and indigenous people continue to have less
    access to healthcare services. Nicaragua's total fertility rate has
    fallen from around 6 children per woman in 1980 to just above
    replacement level today, but the high birth rate among adolescents
    perpetuates a cycle of poverty and low educational attainment.
    Nicaraguans emigrate primarily to Costa Rica and to a lesser extent the
    United States. Nicaraguan men have been migrating seasonally to Costa
    Rica to harvest bananas and coffee since the early 20th century.
    Political turmoil, civil war, and natural disasters from the 1970s
    through the 1990s dramatically increased the flow of refugees and
    permanent migrants seeking jobs, higher wages, and better social and
    healthcare benefits. Since 2000, Nicaraguan emigration to Costa Rica
    has slowed and stabilized. Today roughly 300,000 Nicaraguans are
    permanent residents of Costa Rica - about 75% of the foreign population
    - and thousands more migrate seasonally for work, many illegally.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Nicaragua, the poorest country in Central America and the second
    poorest in the Western Hemisphere, has widespread underemployment and
    poverty. The Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free
    Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) has been in effect since April 2006 and has
    expanded export opportunities for many agricultural and manufactured
    goods. Textiles and agriculture combined account for nearly 50% of
    Nicaragua's exports. In 2013, the government granted a 100-year
    concession to a newly formed Chinese-run company to finance and build
    an inter-oceanic canal and related projects, at an estimated cost of
    $40 billion. The economy grew 4.6% in 2013, despite a 33% decline in
    coffee export revenues due to a coffee rust fungus.

    over the delimitations of the San Juan River and the northern tip of
    Calero Island to the ICJ; in 2009, the ICJ ruled that Costa Rican
    vessels carrying out police activities could not use the river, but
    official Costa Rican vessels providing essential services to riverside
    inhabitants and Costa Rican tourists could travel freely on the river;
    in 2011, the ICJ provisionally ruled that both countries must remove
    personnel from the disputed area; in 2013, the ICJ rejected Nicaragua's
    2012 suit to halt Costa Rica's construction of a highway paralleling
    the river on the grounds of irreparable environmental damage; in 2013,
    the ICJ, regarding the disputed territory, ordered that Nicaragua
    should refrain from dredging or canal construction and refill and
    repair damage caused by trenches connecting the river to the Caribbean
    and upheld its 2010 ruling that Nicaragua must remove all personnel; in
    early 2014, Costa Rica brought Nicaragua to the ICJ over offshore oil
    concessions in the disputed region
