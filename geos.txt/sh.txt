Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha
=============================================

(overseas territory of the UK)


Introduction

  Background:
    Saint Helena is a British Overseas Territory consisting of Saint Helena
    and Ascension Islands, and the island group of Tristan da Cunha.
    Saint Helena: Uninhabited when first discovered by the Portuguese in
    1502, Saint Helena was garrisoned by the British during the 17th
    century. It acquired fame as the place of Napoleon BONAPARTE's exile
    from 1815 until his death in 1821, but its importance as a port of call
    declined after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. During the
    Anglo-Boer War in South Africa, several thousand Boer prisoners were
    confined on the island between 1900 and 1903.
    Ascension Island: This barren and uninhabited island was discovered and
    named by the Portuguese in 1503. The British garrisoned the island in
    1815 to prevent a rescue of Napoleon from Saint Helena. It served as a
    provisioning station for the Royal Navy's West Africa Squadron on
    anti-slavery patrol. The island remained under Admiralty control until
    1922, when it became a dependency of Saint Helena. During World War II,
    the UK permitted the US to construct an airfield on Ascension in
    support of transatlantic flights to Africa and anti-submarine
    operations in the South Atlantic. In the 1960s the island became an
    important space tracking station for the US. In 1982, Ascension was an
    essential staging area for British forces during the Falklands War. It
    remains a critical refueling point in the air-bridge from the UK to the
    South Atlantic.
    Tristan da Cunha: The island group consists of the islands of Tristan
    da Cunha, Nightingale, Inaccessible, and Gough. Tristan da Cunha is
    named after its Portuguese discoverer (1506); it was garrisoned by the
    British in 1816 to prevent any attempt to rescue Napoleon from Saint
    Helena. Gough and Inaccessible Islands have been designated World
    Heritage Sites. South Africa leases a site for a meteorological station
    on Gough Island.

    fishing, raising livestock, and sales of handicrafts. Because there are
    few jobs, 25% of the work force has left to seek employment on
    Ascension Island, on the Falklands, and in the UK.
