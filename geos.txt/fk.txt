Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)
=================================

(overseas territory of the UK; also claimed by Argentina)


Introduction

  Background:
    Although first sighted by an English navigator in 1592, the first
    landing (English) did not occur until almost a century later in 1690,
    and the first settlement (French) was not established until 1764. The
    colony was turned over to Spain two years later and the islands have
    since been the subject of a territorial dispute, first between Britain
    and Spain, then between Britain and Argentina. The UK asserted its
    claim to the islands by establishing a naval garrison there in 1833.
    Argentina invaded the islands on 2 April 1982. The British responded
    with an expeditionary force that landed seven weeks later and after
    fierce fighting forced an Argentine surrender on 14 June 1982. With
    hostilities ended and Argentine forces withdrawn, UK administration
    resumed. In response to renewed calls from Argentina for Britain to
    relinquish control of the islands, a referendum was held in March 2013,
    which resulted in 99.8% of the population voting to remain a part of
    the UK.

    51 45 S, 59 00 W

  Map references:
    South America

  Area:
    total: 12,173 sq km
    land: 12,173 sq km
    water: 0 sq km
    note: includes the two main islands of East and West Falkland and about
    200 small islands

  Climate:
    cold marine; strong westerly winds, cloudy, humid; rain occurs on more
    than half of days in year; average annual rainfall is 24 inches in
    Stanley; occasional snow all year, except in January and February, but
    typically does not accumulate

  Terrain:
    rocky, hilly, mountainous with some boggy, undulating plains

  Environment - current issues:
    overfishing by unlicensed vessels is a problem; reindeer were

    Chornobyl disaster

  Geography - note:
    deeply indented coast provides good natural harbors; short growing
    season

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    The economy was formerly based on agriculture, mainly sheep farming but
    fishing and tourism currently comprise the bulk of economic activity.
    In 1987, the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign
    trawlers operating within the Falkland Islands' exclusive fishing zone.
    These license fees net more than $40 million per year, which help
    support the island's health, education, and welfare system. The waters
    around the Falkland Islands are known for their squid, which account
    for around 75% of the annual 200,000 ton fish catch. Dairy farming
    supports domestic consumption; crops furnish winter fodder. Foreign
    exchange earnings come from shipments of high-grade wool to the UK and
    from the sale of postage stamps and coins. In 2001, the government
    purchased 100 reindeer with the intent to increase the number to 10,000
    over the following 20 years so that venison could be exported to
    Scandinavia and Chile. Tourism, especially eco-tourism, is increasing
    rapidly, with about 69,000 visitors in 2009. The British military
    presence also provides a sizeable economic boost. The islands are now
    self-financing except for defense. In 1993 the British Geological
    Survey announced a 200-mile oil exploration zone around the islands,
    and early seismic surveys suggest substantial reserves capable of
    producing 500,000 barrels per day. Political tensions between the UK
    and Argentina remain high following the start of oil drilling
    activities in the waters. In September 2011, a British exploration firm
    announced that it plans to commence oil production in 2016.
