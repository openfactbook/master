Turks and Caicos Islands
========================

(overseas territory of the UK)


Introduction

  Background:
    The islands were part of the UK's Jamaican colony until 1962, when they
    assumed the status of a separate crown colony upon Jamaica's
    independence. The governor of The Bahamas oversaw affairs from 1965 to
    1973. With Bahamian independence, the islands received a separate
    governor in 1973. Although independence was agreed upon for 1982, the
    policy was reversed and the islands remain a British overseas
    territory.
