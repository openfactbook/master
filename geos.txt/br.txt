Brazil
======


Introduction

  Background:
    Following more than three centuries under Portuguese rule, Brazil
    gained its independence in 1822, maintaining a monarchical system of
    government until the abolition of slavery in 1888 and the subsequent
    proclamation of a republic by the military in 1889. Brazilian coffee
    exporters politically dominated the country until populist leader
    Getulio VARGAS rose to power in 1930. By far the largest and most
    populous country in South America, Brazil underwent more than a half
    century of populist and military government until 1985, when the
    military regime peacefully ceded power to civilian rulers. Brazil
    continues to pursue industrial and agricultural growth and development
    of its interior. Exploiting vast natural resources and a large labor
    pool, it is today South America's leading economic power and a regional
    leader, one of the first in the area to begin an economic recovery.
    High income inequality and crime remain pressing problems, as well as
    recent years' slow down in economic growth.

    (2010 est.)

  Demographic profile:
    Brazil's rapid fertility decline since the 1960s is the main factor
    behind the country's slowing population growth rate, aging population,
    and fast-paced demographic transition. Brasilia has not taken full
    advantage of its large working-age population to develop its human
    capital and strengthen its social and economic institutions but is
    funding a study abroad program to bring advanced skills back to the
    country. The current favorable age structure will begin to shift around
    2025, with the labor force shrinking and the elderly starting to
    compose an increasing share of the total population. Well-funded public
    pensions have nearly wiped out poverty among the elderly, and Bolsa
    Familia and other social programs have lifted tens of millions out of
    poverty. More than half of Brazil's population is considered middle
    class, but poverty and income inequality levels remain high; the
    Northeast, North, and Center-West, women, and black, mixed race, and
    indigenous populations are disproportionately affected. Disparities in
    opportunities foster social exclusion and contribute to Brazil's high
    crime rate, particularly violent crime in cities and favelas.
    Brazil has traditionally been a net recipient of immigrants, with its
    southeast being the prime destination. After the importation of African
    slaves was outlawed in the mid-19th century, Brazil sought Europeans
    (Italians, Portuguese, Spaniards, and Germans) and later Asians
    (Japanese) to work in agriculture, especially coffee cultivation.
    Recent immigrants come mainly from Argentina, Chile, and Andean
    countries (many are unskilled illegal migrants) or are returning
    Brazilian nationals. Since Brazil's economic downturn in the 1980s,
    emigration to the United States, Europe, and Japan has been rising but
    is negligible relative to Brazil's total population. The majority of
    these emigrants are well-educated and middle-class. Fewer Brazilian
    peasants are emigrating to neighboring countries to take up
    agricultural work.

    celestial globe with 27 white five-pointed stars; the globe has a white
    equatorial band with the motto ORDEM E PROGRESSO (Order and Progress);
    the current flag was inspired by the banner of the former Empire of
    Brazil (1822-1889); on the imperial flag, the green represented the
    House of Braganza of Pedro I, the first Emperor of Brazil, while the
    yellow stood for the Habsburg Family of his wife; on the modern flag
    the green represents the forests of the country and the yellow rhombus
    its mineral wealth; the blue circle and stars, which replaced the coat
    of arms of the original flag, depict the sky over Rio de Janeiro on the
    morning of 15 November 1889 - the day the Republic of Brazil was
    declared; the number of stars has changed with the creation of new
    states and has risen from an original 21 to the current 27 (one for
    each state and the Federal District)

    adopted


Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Characterized by large and well-developed agricultural, mining,
    manufacturing, and service sectors, and a rapidly expanding middle
    class, Brazil's economy outweighs that of all other South American
    countries, and Brazil is expanding its presence in world markets. Since
    2003, Brazil has steadily improved its macroeconomic stability,
    building up foreign reserves, and reducing its debt profile by shifting
    its debt burden toward real denominated and domestically held
    instruments. In 2008, Brazil became a net external creditor and two
    ratings agencies awarded investment grade status to its debt. After
    strong growth in 2007 and 2008, the onset of the global financial
    crisis hit Brazil in 2008. Brazil experienced two quarters of
    recession, as global demand for Brazil's commodity-based exports
    dwindled and external credit dried up. However, Brazil was one of the
    first emerging markets to begin a recovery. In 2010, consumer and
    investor confidence revived and GDP growth reached 7.5%, the highest
    growth rate in the past 25 years. Rising inflation led the authorities
    to take measures to cool the economy; these actions and the
    deteriorating international economic situation slowed growth in
    2011-13. Unemployment is at historic lows and Brazil's traditionally
    high level of income inequality has declined for each of the last 14
    years. Brazil's historically high interest rates have made it an
    attractive destination for foreign investors. Large capital inflows
    over the past several years have contributed to the appreciation of the
    currency, hurting the competitiveness of Brazilian manufacturing and
    leading the government to intervene in foreign exchange markets and
    raise taxes on some foreign capital inflows. President Dilma ROUSSEFF
    has retained the previous administration's commitment to inflation
    targeting by the central bank, a floating exchange rate, and fiscal
    restraint.
