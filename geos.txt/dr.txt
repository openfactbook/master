Dominican Republic
==================


Introduction

  Background:
    The Taino - indigenous inhabitants of Hispaniola prior to the arrival
    of the Europeans - divided the island into five chiefdoms and
    territories. Christopher COLUMBUS explored and claimed the island on
    his first voyage in 1492; it became a springboard for Spanish conquest
    of the Caribbean and the American mainland. In 1697, Spain recognized
    French dominion over the western third of the island, which in 1804
    became Haiti. The remainder of the island, by then known as Santo
    Domingo, sought to gain its own independence in 1821 but was conquered
    and ruled by the Haitians for 22 years; it finally attained
    independence as the Dominican Republic in 1844. In 1861, the Dominicans
    voluntarily returned to the Spanish Empire, but two years later they
    launched a war that restored independence in 1865. A legacy of
    unsettled, mostly non-representative rule followed, capped by the
    dictatorship of Rafael Leonidas TRUJILLO from 1930 to 1961. Juan BOSCH
    was elected president in 1962 but was deposed in a military coup in
    1963. In 1965, the United States led an intervention in the midst of a
    civil war sparked by an uprising to restore BOSCH. In 1966, Joaquin
    BALAGUER defeated BOSCH in an election to become president. BALAGUER
    maintained a tight grip on power for most of the next 30 years when
    international reaction to flawed elections forced him to curtail his
    term in 1996. Since then, regular competitive elections have been held
    in which opposition candidates have won the presidency. Former
    President Leonel FERNANDEZ Reyna (first term 1996-2000) won election to
    a new term in 2004 following a constitutional amendment allowing
    presidents to serve more than one term, and was later reelected to a
    second consecutive term. In 2012, Danilo MEDINA Sanchez was elected
    president.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    The Dominican Republic has long been viewed primarily as an exporter of
    sugar, coffee, and tobacco, but in recent years the service sector has
    overtaken agriculture as the economy's largest employer, due to growth
    in telecommunications, tourism, and free trade zones. The economy is
    highly dependent upon the US, the destination for approximately half of
    exports. Remittances from the US amount to about 5% of GDP, equivalent
    to about a third of exports and two-thirds of tourism receipts. The
    country suffers from marked income inequality; the poorest half of the
    population receives less than one-fifth of GDP, while the richest 10%
    enjoys nearly 40% of GDP. High unemployment and underemployment remains
    an important long-term challenge. The Central America-Dominican
    Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) came into force in March 2007,
    boosting investment and exports and reducing losses to the Asian
    garment industry. The Dominican Republic's economy rebounded from the
    global recession in 2010-13, and the fiscal situation is improving. A
    tax reform package passed in November 2012 and a reduction in
    government spending helped to narrow the central government budget
    deficit from 6.6% of GDP in 2012 to below 3% in 2013. A successful
    government bond placement in 2013 helped finance the deficit.
