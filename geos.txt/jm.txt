Jamaica
=======


Introduction

  Background:
    The island - discovered by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1494 - was settled
    by the Spanish early in the 16th century. The native Taino, who had
    inhabited Jamaica for centuries, were gradually exterminated and
    replaced by African slaves. England seized the island in 1655 and
    established a plantation economy based on sugar, cocoa, and coffee. The
    abolition of slavery in 1834 freed a quarter million slaves, many of
    whom became small farmers. Jamaica gradually increased its independence
    from Britain. In 1958 it joined other British Caribbean colonies in
    forming the Federation of the West Indies. Jamaica gained full
    independence when it withdrew from the Federation in 1962.
    Deteriorating economic conditions during the 1970s led to recurrent
    violence as rival gangs affiliated with the major political parties
    evolved into powerful organized crime networks involved in
    international drug smuggling and money laundering. Violent crime, drug
    trafficking, and poverty pose significant challenges to the government
    today. Nonetheless, many rural and resort areas remain relatively safe
    and contribute substantially to the economy.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    The Jamaican economy is heavily dependent on services, which accounts
    for nearly 80% of GDP. The country continues to derive most of its
    foreign exchange from tourism, remittances, and bauxite/alumina.
    Remittances and tourism each account for 30% of GDP, while
    bauxite/alumina exports make up roughly 5% of GDP. The bauxite/alumina
    sector was most affected by the global downturn while the tourism
    industry and remittance flow remained resilient. Jamaica's economy
    faces many challenges to growth: high crime and corruption, large-scale
    unemployment and underemployment, and a debt-to-GDP ratio of about
    140%. The attendant debt servicing cost consumes a large portion of the
    government's budget, limiting its ability to fund the critical
    infrastructure and social programs required to drive growth. Jamaica's
    economic growth rate in the recent past has been stagnant, averaging
    less than 1% per year for over 20 years. Jamaica's onerous public debt
    burden is largely the result of government bailouts to ailing sectors
    of the economy, most notably to the financial sector. In early 2010,
    the Jamaican Government initiated the Jamaica Debt Exchange to retire
    high-priced domestic bonds and reduce annual debt servicing. Despite
    these efforts, debt continued to be a serious concern, forcing the
    government to negotiate and sign a new IMF agreement in May 2013 to
    gain access to approximately $1 billion additional funds. As a
    precursor, the government instigated a second National Debt Exchange in
    2012. The IMF deal requires the government to reform its tax system,
    eliminate discretionary tax exemptions and waivers, and achieve an
    annual surplus of 7.5%, excluding debt payments, to reduce its debt
    below 100% of GDP by 2020. The SIMPSON-MILLER administration now faces
    the difficult prospect of having to achieve fiscal discipline to
    maintain debt payments while simultaneously attacking a serious crime
    problem that is hampering economic growth. High unemployment
    exacerbates the crime problem, including gang violence that is fueled
    by the drug trade. The IMF approved a four-year $932 million Extended
    Fund Facility arrangement for Jamaica in May 2013.
