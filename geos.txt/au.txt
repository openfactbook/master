Introduction

  Background:
    Once the center of power for the large Austro-Hungarian Empire, Austria
    was reduced to a small republic after its defeat in World War I.
    Following annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938 and subsequent occupation
    by the victorious Allies in 1945, Austria's status remained unclear for
    a decade. A State Treaty signed in 1955 ended the occupation,
    recognized Austria's independence, and forbade unification with
    Germany. A constitutional law that same year declared the country's
    "perpetual neutrality" as a condition for Soviet military withdrawal.
    The Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 and Austria's entry into the
    European Union in 1995 have altered the meaning of this neutrality. A
    prosperous, democratic country, Austria entered the EU Economic and
    Monetary Union in 1999.

    industrial plants and from trucks transiting Austria between northern
    and southern Europe

  Geography - note:
    landlocked; strategic location at the crossroads of central Europe with
    many easily traversable Alpine passes and valleys; major river is the
    Danube; population is concentrated on eastern lowlands because of steep
    slopes, poor soils, and low temperatures elsewhere

  Flag description:
    three equal horizontal bands of red (top), white, and red; the flag
    design is certainly one of the oldest - if not the oldest - national
    banners in the world; according to tradition, in 1191, following a
    fierce battle in the Third Crusade, Duke Leopold V of Austria's white
    tunic became completely blood-spattered; upon removal of his wide belt
    or sash, a white band was revealed; the red-white-red color combination
    was subsequently adopted as his banner

  National anthem:
    name: "Bundeshymne" (Federal Hymn)
    lyrics/music: Paula von PRERADOVIC/Wolfgang Amadeus MOZART or Johann
    HOLZER (disputed)
    note: adopted 1947; the anthem is also known as "Land der Berge, Land
    am Strome" (Land of the Mountains, Land on the River); Austria adopted
    a new national anthem after World War II to replace the former imperial
    anthem composed by Franz Josef HAYDN, which had been appropriated by
    Germany in 1922 and was now associated with the Nazi regime


Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Austria, with its well-developed market economy, skilled labor force,
    and high standard of living, is closely tied to other EU economies,
    especially Germany's. Its economy features a large service sector, a
    sound industrial sector, and a small, but highly developed agricultural
    sector. Following several years of solid foreign demand for Austrian
    exports and record employment growth, the international financial
    crisis of 2008 and subsequent global economic downturn led to a sharp
    but brief recession. Austrian GDP contracted 3.8% in 2009 but saw
    positive growth of about 2% in 2010 and 2.7% in 2011. Growth fell to
    0.6% in 2012. Unemployment did not rise as steeply in Austria as
    elsewhere in Europe, partly because the government subsidized reduced
    working hour schemes to allow companies to retain employees. The 2012
    unemployment rate of 4.3% was the lowest within the EU. Stabilization
    measures, stimulus spending, and an income tax reform pushed the budget
    deficit to 4.5% in 2010 and 2.6% in 2011, from only about 0.9% in 2008.
    The international financial crisis of 2008 caused difficulties for
    Austria's largest banks whose extensive operations in central, eastern,
    and southeastern Europe faced large losses. The government provided
    bank support - including in some instances, nationalization - to
    support aggregate demand and stabilize the banking system. Austria's
    fiscal position compares favorably with other euro-zone countries, but
    it faces external risks, such as Austrian banks' continued exposure to
    Central and Eastern Europe as well as political and economic
    uncertainties caused by the European sovereign debt crisis. In 2011 the
    government attempted to pass a constitutional amendment limiting public
    debt to 60% of GDP by 2020, but it was unable to obtain sufficient
    support in parliament and instead passed the measure as a simple law.
    In March 2012, the Austrian parliament approved an austerity package
    consisting of a mix of expenditure cuts and new revenues that will
    bring public finances into balance by 2016. In 2012, the budget deficit
    rose to 3.1% of GDP.
