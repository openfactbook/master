New Zealand
===========


Introduction

  Background:
    The Polynesian Maori reached New Zealand in about A.D. 800. In 1840,
    their chieftains entered into a compact with Britain, the Treaty of
    Waitangi, in which they ceded sovereignty to Queen Victoria while
    retaining territorial rights. That same year, the British began the
    first organized colonial settlement. A series of land wars between 1843
    and 1872 ended with the defeat of the native peoples. The British
    colony of New Zealand became an independent dominion in 1907 and
    supported the UK militarily in both world wars. New Zealand's full
    participation in a number of defense alliances lapsed by the 1980s. In
    recent years, the government has sought to address longstanding Maori
    grievances.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Over the past 20 years the government has transformed New Zealand from
    an agrarian economy dependent on concessionary British market access to
    a more industrialized, free market economy that can compete globally.
    This dynamic growth has boosted real incomes - but left behind some at
    the bottom of the ladder - and broadened and deepened the technological
    capabilities of the industrial sector. Per capita income rose for ten
    consecutive years until 2007 in purchasing power parity terms, but fell
    in 2008-09. Debt-driven consumer spending drove robust growth in the
    first half of the decade, helping fuel a large balance of payments
    deficit that posed a challenge for economic managers. Inflationary
    pressures caused the central bank to raise its key rate steadily from
    January 2004 until it was among the highest in the OECD in 2007-08;
    international capital inflows attracted to the high rates further
    strengthened the currency and housing market, however, aggravating the
    current account deficit. The economy fell into recession before the
    start of the global financial crisis and contracted for five
    consecutive quarters in 2008-09. In line with global peers, the central
    bank cut interest rates aggressively and the government developed
    fiscal stimulus measures. The economy pulled out of recession late in
    2009, and achieved 2-3% per year growth in 2010-13. Nevertheless, key
    trade sectors remain vulnerable to weak external demand. The government
    plans to raise productivity growth and develop infrastructure, while
    reining in government spending.
