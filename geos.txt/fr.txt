France

Introduction

  Background:
    France today is one of the most modern countries in the world and is a
    leader among European nations. It plays an influential global role as a
    permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, NATO, the G-8,
    the G-20, the EU and other multilateral organizations. France rejoined
    NATO's integrated military command structure in 2009, reversing DE
    GAULLE's 1966 decision to take French forces out of NATO. Since 1958,
    it has constructed a hybrid presidential-parliamentary governing system
    resistant to the instabilities experienced in earlier, more purely
    parliamentary administrations. In recent decades, its reconciliation
    and cooperation with Germany have proved central to the economic
    integration of Europe, including the introduction of a common currency,
    the euro, in January 1999. In the early 21st century, five French
    overseas entities - French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and
    Reunion - became French regions and were made part of France proper.

    note: adopted 1795, restored 1870; originally known as "Chant de Guerre
    pour l'Armee du Rhin" (War Song for the Army of the Rhine), the
    National Guard of Marseille made the song famous by singing it while
    marching into Paris in 1792 during the French Revolutionary Wars


Economy

  Economy - overview:
    The French economy is diversified across all sectors. The government
    has partially or fully privatized many large companies, including Air
    France, France Telecom, Renault, and Thales. However, the government
    maintains a strong presence in some sectors, particularly power, public
    transport, and defense industries. With at least 82 million foreign
    tourists per year, France is the most visited country in the world and
    maintains the third largest income in the world from tourism. France's
    leaders remain committed to a capitalism in which they maintain social
    equity by means of laws, tax policies, and social spending that
    mitigate economic inequality. France's real GDP stagnated in 2012 and
    2013. The unemployment rate (including overseas territories) increased
    from 7.8% in 2008 to 10.2% in 2013. Youth unemployment in metropolitan
    France decreased from a high of 25.4% in the fourth quarter of 2012 to
    22.8% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Lower-than-expected growth and
    high spending have strained France's public finances. The budget
    deficit rose sharply from 3.3% of GDP in 2008 to 7.5% of GDP in 2009
    before improving to 4.1% of GDP in 2013, while France's public debt
    rose from 68% of GDP to nearly 94% over the same period. In accordance
    with its EU obligations, France is targeting a deficit of 3.6% of GDP
    in 2014 and 2.8% in 2015. The administration of President Francois
    HOLLANDE has implemented greater state support for employment, the
    separation of banks' traditional deposit taking and lending activities
    from more speculative businesses, increasing the top corporate and
    personal tax rates, including a temporary 75% tax on wages over one
    million euros, and hiring an additional 60,000 teachers during his
    five-year term. In January 2014 HOLLANDE proposed a “Responsibility
    Pact” aimed primarily at lowering labor costs in return for
    businesses’ commitment to create jobs. Despite stagnant growth and
    fiscal challenges, France's borrowing costs have declined in recent
    years because investors remain attracted to the liquidity of France’s
    bonds.
