Malta
=====


Introduction

  Background:
    Great Britain formally acquired possession of Malta in 1814. The island
    staunchly supported the UK through both world wars and remained in the
    Commonwealth when it became independent in 1964; a decade later it
    declared itself a republic. Since about the mid-1980s, the island has
    transformed itself into a freight transshipment point, a financial
    center, and a tourist destination. Malta became an EU member in May
    2004 and began using the euro as currency in 2008.

  Flag description:
    two equal vertical bands of white (hoist side) and red; in the upper

    red; according to legend, the colors are taken from the red and white
    checkered banner of Count Roger of Sicily who removed a bi-colored
    corner and granted it to Malta in 1091; an uncontested explanation is
    that the colors are those of the Knights of Saint John who ruled Malta
    from 1530 to 1798; in 1942, King George VI of the United Kingdom
    awarded the George Cross to the islanders for their exceptional bravery
    and gallantry in World War II; since independence in 1964, the George
    Cross bordered in red has appeared directly on the white field

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Malta - the smallest economy in the euro zone - produces only about 20%
    of its food needs, has limited fresh water supplies, and has few
    domestic energy sources. Malta's geographic position between Europe and
    North Africa makes it a target for irregular migration, which has
    strained Malta's political and economic resources. Malta's fertility
    rate is below the EU average, and population growth in recent years has
    largely been from immigration, putting increasing pressure on the
    pension system. Malta adopted the euro on 1 January 2008. Malta's
    economy is dependent on foreign trade, manufacturing, and tourism, and
    was hurt by the global economic downturn, but fared better than most
    other EU member states. Malta has low unemployment relative to other
    European countries, and growth has recovered since the 2009 recession.
    Malta's financial services industry has grown in recent years and it
    has avoided contagion from the European financial crisis, largely
    because its debt is mostly held domestically and its banks have low
    exposure to the sovereign debt of peripheral European countries. The EU
    reopened an excessive deficit procedure against Malta in June 2013,
    having found that its forecasted deficit for the year was likely to
    exceed 3% of GDP.
