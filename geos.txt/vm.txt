Introduction

  Background:
    The conquest of Vietnam by France began in 1858 and was completed by
    1884. It became part of French Indochina in 1887. Vietnam declared
    independence after World War II, but France continued to rule until its
    1954 defeat by communist forces under Ho Chi MINH. Under the Geneva
    Accords of 1954, Vietnam was divided into the communist North and
    anti-communist South. US economic and military aid to South Vietnam
    grew through the 1960s in an attempt to bolster the government, but US
    armed forces were withdrawn following a cease-fire agreement in 1973.
    Two years later, North Vietnamese forces overran the South reuniting
    the country under communist rule. Despite the return of peace, for over
    a decade the country experienced little economic growth because of
    conservative leadership policies, the persecution and mass exodus of
    individuals - many of them successful South Vietnamese merchants - and
    growing international isolation. However, since the enactment of
    Vietnam's "doi moi" (renovation) policy in 1986, Vietnamese authorities
    have committed to increased economic liberalization and enacted
    structural reforms needed to modernize the economy and to produce more
    competitive, export-driven industries. The communist leaders, however,
    maintain control on political expression and have resisted outside
    calls to improve human rights. The country continues to experience
    small-scale protests from various groups - the vast majority connected
    to land-use issues, calls for increased political space, and the lack
    of equitable mechanisms for resolving disputes. Various ethnic
    minorities, such as the Montagnards of the Central Highlands and the
    Khmer Krom in the southern delta region, have also held protests.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Vietnam is a densely-populated developing country that has been
    transitioning from the rigidities of a centrally-planned economy since
    1986. Vietnamese authorities have reaffirmed their commitment to
    economic modernization in recent years. Vietnam joined the World Trade
    Organization in January 2007, which has promoted more competitive,
    export-driven industries. Vietnam became an official negotiating
    partner in the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement in 2010.
    Agriculture's share of economic output has continued to shrink from
    about 25% in 2000 to less than 20% in 2013, while industry's share
    increased from 36% to more than 42% in the same period. State-owned
    enterprises account for about 40% of GDP. Poverty has declined
    significantly, and Vietnam is working to create jobs to meet the
    challenge of a labor force that is growing by more than one million
    people every year. The global recession hurt Vietnam's export-oriented
    economy, with GDP in 2013 growing at 5%, the slowest rate of growth
    since 1999. In 2013, however, exports increased by more than 12%,
    year-on-year; several administrative actions brought the trade deficit
    back into balance. Between 2008 and 2011, Vietnam's managed currency,
    the dong, was devalued in excess of 20%, but its value remained
    relatively stable in 2013. Hanoi has oscillated between promoting
    growth and emphasizing macroeconomic stability in recent years. In
    February 2011, the government shifted from policies aimed at achieving
    a high rate of economic growth, which had stoked inflation, to those
    aimed at stabilizing the economy, through tighter monetary and fiscal
    control. Although Vietnam unveiled a broad, "three pillar" economic
    reform program in early 2012, proposing the restructuring of public
    investment, state-owned enterprises, and the banking sector, little
    perceptible progress has been made. Vietnam's economy continues to face
    challenges from an undercapitalized banking sector. Non-performing
    loans weigh heavily on banks and businesses.

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    southeast Asian states have enhanced border surveillance to check the
    spread of avian flu; Cambodia and Laos protest Vietnamese squatters and
    armed encroachments along border; Cambodia accuses Vietnam of a wide
    variety of illicit cross-border activities; progress on a joint
    development area with Cambodia is hampered by an unresolved dispute
    over sovereignty of offshore islands; an estimated 300,000 Vietnamese
    refugees reside in China; establishment of a maritime boundary with
    Cambodia is hampered by unresolved dispute over the sovereignty of
    offshore islands; the decade-long demarcation of the China-Vietnam land
    boundary was completed in 2009; China occupies the Paracel Islands also
    claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan; Brunei claims a maritime boundary
    extending beyond as far as a median with Vietnam, thus asserting an
    implicit claim to Lousia Reef; the 2002 "Declaration on the Conduct of
    Parties in the South China Sea" has eased tensions but falls short of a
    legally binding "code of conduct" desired by several of the disputants;
    Vietnam continues to expand construction of facilities in the Spratly
    Islands; in March 2005, the national oil companies of China, the
    Philippines, and Vietnam signed a joint accord to conduct marine
    seismic activities in the Spratly Islands; Economic Exclusion Zone

    recognized as Cambodian citizens; Vietnamese women who gave up their
    citizenship to marry foreign men have found themselves stateless after
    divorcing and returning home to Vietnam; the government addressed this
    problem in 2009, and Vietnamese women are beginning to reclaim their
    citizenship

  Illicit drugs:
    minor producer of opium poppy; probable minor transit point for
