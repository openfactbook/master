El Salvador
===========


Introduction

  Background:
    El Salvador achieved independence from Spain in 1821 and from the
    Central American Federation in 1839. A 12-year civil war, which cost
    about 75,000 lives, was brought to a close in 1992 when the government
    and leftist rebels signed a treaty that provided for military and
    political reforms.

People and Society

  Nationality:
    noun: Salvadoran(s)
    adjective: Salvadoran

  Ethnic groups:
    mestizo 86.3%, white 12.7%, Amerindian 1% (2007 census)

  Languages:
    Spanish (official), Nahua (among some Amerindians)

  Religions:
    Roman Catholic 57.1%, Protestant 21.2%, Jehovah's Witnesses 1.9%,
    Mormon 0.7%, other religions 2.3%, none 16.8% (2003 est.)

  Demographic profile:
    El Salvador is the smallest and most densely populated country in
    Central America. It is well into its demographic transition,
    experiencing slower population growth, a decline in its number of
    youths, and the gradual aging of its population. The increased use of
    family planning has substantially lowered El Salvador's fertility rate,
    from approximately 6 children per woman in the 1970s to replacement
    level today. A 2008 national family planning survey showed that female
    sterilization remained the most common contraception method in El
    Salvador - its sterilization rate is among the highest in Latin America
    and the Caribbean - but that the use of injectable contraceptives is
    growing. Fertility differences between rich and poor and urban and
    rural women are narrowing.
    Salvadorans fled during the 1979 to 1992 civil war mainly to the United
    States but also to Canada and to neighboring Mexico, Guatemala,
    Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. Emigration to the United States
    increased again in the 1990s and 2000s as a result of deteriorating
    economic conditions, natural disasters (Hurricane Mitch in 1998 and
    earthquakes in 2001), and family reunification. At least 20% of El
    Salvador's population lives abroad. The remittances they send home
    account for close to 20% of GDP, are the second largest source of
    external income after exports, and have helped reduce poverty.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    The smallest country in Central America geographically, El Salvador has
    the fourth largest economy in the region. With the global recession,
    real GDP contracted in 2009 and economic growth has since remained low,
    averaging less than 2% from 2010 to 2013. Remittances accounted for 16%
    of GDP in 2013 and were received by about a third of all households. In
    2006, El Salvador was the first country to ratify the Dominican
    Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), which has
    bolstered the export of processed foods, sugar, and ethanol, and
    supported investment in the apparel sector amid increased Asian
    competition. The Salvadoran Government maintained fiscal discipline
    during post-war reconstruction and reconstruction following earthquakes
    in 2001 and hurricanes in 1998 and 2005, but El Salvador's external
    debt has been growing over the last several years, amounting to some
    57% of GDP in 2013. In September 2013, El Salvador was awarded a $277
    million second compact with the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC)
    - a United States Government agency aimed at stimulating economic
    growth and reducing poverty - to improve El Salvador's competitiveness
    and productivity in international markets.
