Mongolia
========


Introduction

  Background:
    The Mongols gained fame in the 13th century when under Chinggis KHAAN
    they established a huge Eurasian empire through conquest. After his
    death the empire was divided into several powerful Mongol states, but
    these broke apart in the 14th century. The Mongols eventually retired
    to their original steppe homelands and in the late 17th century came
    under Chinese rule. Mongolia won its independence in 1921 with Soviet
    backing and a communist regime was installed in 1924. The modern
    country of Mongolia, however, represents only part of the Mongols'
    historical homeland; more ethnic Mongolians live in the Inner Mongolia
    Autonomous Region in the People's Republic of China than in Mongolia.
    Following a peaceful democratic revolution, the ex-communist Mongolian
    People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) won elections in 1990 and 1992, but
    was defeated by the Democratic Union Coalition (DUC) in the 1996
    parliamentary election. The MPRP won an overwhelming majority in the
    2000 parliamentary election, but the party lost seats in the 2004
    election and shared power with democratic coalition parties from
    2004-08. The MPRP regained a solid majority in the 2008 parliamentary
    elections but nevertheless formed a coalition government with the
    Democratic Party that lasted until January 2012. In 2009, current
    President ELBEGDORJ of the Democratic Party was elected to office and
    was re-elected for his second term in June 2013. In 2010, the MPRP
    voted to retake the name of the Mongolian People's Party (MPP), a name
    it used in the early 1920s. Shortly thereafter, a new party was formed
    by former president ENKHBAYAR, which adopted the MPRP name. In the 2012
    Parliamentary elections, a coalition of four political parties led by
    the Democratic Party, gained control of the Parliament.

    growth that had negative effects on the environment; the burning of
    soft coal in power plants and the lack of enforcement of environmental
    laws severely polluted the air in Ulaanbaatar; deforestation,
    overgrazing, and the converting of virgin land to agricultural
    production increased soil erosion from wind and rain; desertification
    and mining activities had a deleterious effect on the environment

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Mongolia's extensive mineral deposits and attendant growth in
    mining-sector activities have transformed Mongolia's economy, which
    traditionally has been dependent on herding and agriculture. Mongolia's
    copper, gold, coal, molybdenum, fluorspar, uranium, tin, and tungsten
    deposits, among others, have attracted foreign direct investment.
    Soviet assistance, at its height one-third of GDP, disappeared almost
    overnight in 1990 and 1991 at the time of the dismantlement of the
    USSR. The following decade saw Mongolia endure both deep recession,
    because of political inaction and natural disasters, as well as
    economic growth, because of reform-embracing, free-market economics and
    extensive privatization of the formerly state-run economy. The country
    opened a fledgling stock exchange in 1991. Mongolia joined the World
    Trade Organization in 1997 and seeks to expand its participation in
    regional economic and trade regimes. Growth averaged nearly 9% per year
    in 2004-08 largely because of high copper prices globally and new gold
    production. By late 2008, Mongolia was hit hard by the global financial
    crisis. Slower global economic growth hurt the country's exports,
    notably copper, and slashed government revenues. As a result,
    Mongolia's real economy contracted 1.3% in 2009. In early 2009, the
    International Monetary Fund reached a $236 million Stand-by Arrangement
    with Mongolia and the country has largely emerged from the crisis with
    better regulations and closer supervision. The banking sector
    strengthened but weaknesses remain. In October 2009, Mongolia passed
    long-awaited legislation on an investment agreement to develop the Oyu
    Tolgoi mine, considered to be among the world's largest untapped
    copper-gold deposits. Mongolia's ongoing dispute with a foreign
    investor over Oyu Tolgoi, however, has called into question the
    attractiveness of Mongolia as a destination for foreign direct
    investment. Negotiations to develop the massive Tavan Tolgoi coal field
    also have stalled. The economy has grown more than 10% per year since
    2010, largely on the strength of commodity exports to nearby countries
    and high government spending domestically. Mongolia's economy, however,
    faces near-term economic risks from the government's loose fiscal and
    monetary policies, which are contributing to high inflation, and from
    uncertainties in foreign demand for Mongolian exports. Trade with China
    represents more than half of Mongolia's total external trade - China
    receives more than 90% of Mongolia's exports and is Mongolia's largest
    supplier. Mongolia has relied on Russia for energy supplies, leaving it
    vulnerable to price increases; in the first 11 months of 2013, Mongolia
    purchased 76% of its gasoline and diesel fuel and a substantial amount
    of electric power from Russia. A drop in foreign direct investment and
    a decrease in Chinese demand for Mongolia's mineral exports are putting
    pressure on Mongolia's balance of payments. Remittances from Mongolians
    working abroad, particularly in South Korea, are significant.
