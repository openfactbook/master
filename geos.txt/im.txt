Isle of Man
===========

(British crown dependency)


Introduction

  Background:
    Part of the Norwegian Kingdom of the Hebrides until the 13th century
    when it was ceded to Scotland, the isle came under the British crown in
    1765. Current concerns include reviving the almost extinct Manx Gaelic
    language. Isle of Man is a British crown dependency but is not part of
    the UK or of the European Union. However, the UK Government remains
    constitutionally responsible for its defense and international
    representation.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are key sectors of the
    economy. The government offers low taxes and other incentives to
    high-technology companies and financial institutions to locate on the
    island; this has paid off in expanding employment opportunities in
    high-income industries. As a result, agriculture and fishing, once the
    mainstays of the economy, have declined in their contributions to GDP.
    The Isle of Man also attracts online gambling sites and the film
    industry. Trade is mostly with the UK. In January 2013, the Isle of Man
    signed a tax agreement with Guernsey and Jersey, in order to enable the
    islands' authorities to end tax avoidance and evasion. The Isle of Man
    enjoys free access to EU markets.
