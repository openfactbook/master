Niue
====

(self-governing in free association with New Zealand)


Introduction

  Background:
    Niue's remoteness, as well as cultural and linguistic differences
    between its Polynesian inhabitants and those of the adjacent Cook
    Islands, has caused it to be separately administered by New Zealand.
    The population of the island continues to drop (from a peak of 5,200 in
    1966 to an estimated 1,229 in 2013) with substantial emigration to New
    Zealand 2,400 km to the southwest.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    The economy suffers from the typical Pacific island problems of
    geographic isolation, few resources, and a small population. Government
    expenditures regularly exceed revenues, and the shortfall is made up by
    critically needed grants from New Zealand that are used to pay wages to
    public employees. Niue has cut government expenditures by reducing the
    public service by almost half. The agricultural sector consists mainly
    of subsistence gardening, although some cash crops are grown for
    export. Industry consists primarily of small factories to process
    passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The sale of postage
    stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of revenue. The
    island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of population
    because of emigration to New Zealand. Efforts to increase GDP include
    the promotion of tourism and financial services, although the
    International Banking Repeal Act of 2002 resulted in the termination of
    all offshore banking licenses. Economic aid from New Zealand in FY08/09
    was US$5.7 million. While in the process of rebuilding, Niue has been
    dependent on foreign aid.
