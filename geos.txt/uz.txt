Uzbekistan
==========


Introduction

  Background:
    Russia conquered the territory of present-day Uzbekistan in the late
    19th century. Stiff resistance to the Red Army after the Bolshevik
    Revolution was eventually suppressed and a socialist republic
    established in 1924. During the Soviet era, intensive production of
    "white gold" (cotton) and grain led to overuse of agrochemicals and the
    depletion of water supplies, which have left the land degraded and the
    Aral Sea and certain rivers half dry. Independent since 1991, the
    country has lessened its dependence on the cotton monoculture by
    diversifying agricultural production while developing its mineral and
    petroleum export capacity and increasing its manufacturing base.
    However, longserving septuagenarian President Islom KARIMOV, who rose
    through the ranks of the Soviet-era State Planning Committee (Gosplan),
    remains wedded to the concepts of a command economy, creating a
    challenging environment for foreign investment. Current concerns
    include post-KARIMOV succession, terrorism by Islamic militants,
    economic stagnation, and the curtailment of human rights and
    democratization.


Geography

  Location:
    Central Asia, north of Turkmenistan, south of Kazakhstan

  Geographic coordinates:
    41 00 N, 64 00 E

  Map references:
    Asia

  Area:
    total: 447,400 sq km
    land: 425,400 sq km
    water: 22,000 sq km

  Area - comparative:
    slightly larger than California

  Land boundaries:
    total: 6,221 km
    border countries: Afghanistan 137 km, Kazakhstan 2,203 km, Kyrgyzstan
    1,099 km, Tajikistan 1,161 km, Turkmenistan 1,621 km

  Coastline:
    0 km (doubly landlocked); note - Uzbekistan includes the southern
    portion of the Aral Sea with a 420 km shoreline

  Maritime claims:
    none (doubly landlocked)

  Climate:
    mostly midlatitude desert, long, hot summers, mild winters; semiarid
    grassland in east

  Terrain:
    mostly flat-to-rolling sandy desert with dunes; broad, flat intensely
    irrigated river valleys along course of Amu Darya, Syr Darya
    (Sirdaryo), and Zarafshon; Fergana Valley in east surrounded by
    mountainous Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan; shrinking Aral Sea in west

  Elevation extremes:
    lowest point: Sariqamish Kuli -12 m
    highest point: Adelunga Toghi 4,301 m

  Natural resources:
    natural gas, petroleum, coal, gold, uranium, silver, copper, lead and
    zinc, tungsten, molybdenum

  Land use:
    arable land: 9.61%
    permanent crops: 0.8%
    other: 89.58% (2011)

  Environment - current issues:
    shrinkage of the Aral Sea has resulted in growing concentrations of
    chemical pesticides and natural salts; these substances are then blown
    from the increasingly exposed lake bed and contribute to
    desertification and respiratory health problems; water pollution from
    industrial wastes and the heavy use of fertilizers and pesticides is
    the cause of many human health disorders; increasing soil salination;
    soil contamination from buried nuclear processing and agricultural
    chemicals, including DDT

  Environment - international agreements:
    party to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol,
    Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification,
    Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Uzbekistan is a dry, landlocked country; 11% of the land is intensely
    cultivated, in irrigated river valleys. More than 60% of the population
    lives in densely populated rural communities. Export of hydrocarbons,
    primarily natural gas, provides a significant share of foreign exchange
    earnings. Other major export earners include gold and cotton. Despite
    ongoing efforts to diversify crops, Uzbekistani agriculture remains
    largely centered around cotton, although production has dropped by 35%
    since 1991. Uzbekistan is now the world's fifth largest cotton exporter
    and sixth largest producer. The country is addressing international
    criticism for the use of child labor in its cotton harvest. Following
    independence in September 1991, the government sought to prop up its
    Soviet-style command economy with subsidies and tight controls on
    production and prices. While aware of the need to improve the
    investment climate, the government still sponsors measures that often
    increase, not decrease, its control over business decisions. A sharp
    increase in the inequality of income distribution has hurt the lower
    ranks of society since independence. In 2003, the government accepted
    Article VIII obligations under the IMF, providing for full currency
    convertibility. However, strict currency controls and tightening of
    borders have lessened the effects of convertibility and have also led
    to some shortages that have further stifled economic activity. The
    Central Bank often delays or restricts convertibility, especially for
    consumer goods. Uzbekistan's growth has been driven primarily by
    state-led investments and a favorable export environment. In the past
    Uzbekistani authorities have accused US and other foreign companies
    operating in Uzbekistan of violating Uzbekistani laws and have frozen
    and even seized their assets. At the same time, the Uzbekistani
    Government has actively courted several major US and international
    corporations, offering financing and tax advantages. A major US
    automaker opened a powertrain manufacturing facility in Tashkent in
    November 2011, but there have been no sizable US investments since
    then. Diminishing foreign investment and difficulties transporting
    goods across borders further challenge the economy of Uzbekistan.

    18 years of age for compulsory military service; 1-month or 1-year
    conscript service obligation for males; moving toward a professional

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    prolonged drought and cotton monoculture in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan
    created water-sharing difficulties for Amu Darya river states; field
    demarcation of the boundaries with Kazakhstan commenced in 2004; border
    delimitation of 130 km of border with Kyrgyzstan is hampered by serious
    disputes around enclaves and other areas

  Refugees and internally displaced persons:
    IDPs: undetermined (government forcibly relocated an estimated 3,400
    people from villages near the Tajikistan border in 2000-2001; no new
    data is available) (2012)

  Trafficking in persons:
    current situation: Uzbekistan is a source country for men, women, and
    children subjected to forced labor and women and children subjected to
    sex trafficking; adults and children are victims of
    government-organized forced labor during Uzbekistan's annual cotton
    harvest; some Uzbekistani adults are subjected to forced labor in
    Kazakhstan, Russia, and, to a much lesser extent, Ukraine in domestic
    service, agriculture, and the construction and oil industries;
    Uzbekistani women and children, lured with fraudulent job offers, are
    sex trafficked to countries in Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe,
    and Asia; small numbers of Tajikistani and Kyrgyzstani victims have
    been identified in Uzbekistan
    tier rating: Tier 3 - Uzbekistan does not fully comply with the minimum
    standards for the elimination of trafficking and because it is not
    deemed to be making significant efforts to do so, it was downgraded to
    Tier 3 after the maximum of two consecutive annual waivers; the
    government has identified an increased number of sex and transnational
    labor trafficking victims; for the first time a decree was implemented
    banning the forced labor of children under the age of 15 in the annual
    cotton harvest, but government-organized forced labor of adults and
    older children contines in the cotton and reportedly other sectors;
    Uzbekistan does not have a systematic process to proactively identify
    trafficking victims and refer them to protective services (2013)

  Illicit drugs:
    transit country for Afghan narcotics bound for Russian and, to a lesser
    extent, Western European markets; limited illicit cultivation of
    cannabis and small amounts of opium poppy for domestic consumption;
    poppy cultivation almost wiped out by government crop eradication
    program; transit point for heroin precursor chemicals bound for
    Afghanistan
