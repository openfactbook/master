United States
=============


Introduction

  Background:
    Britain's American colonies broke with the mother country in 1776 and
    were recognized as the new nation of the United States of America
    following the Treaty of Paris in 1783. During the 19th and 20th
    centuries, 37 new states were added to the original 13 as the nation
    expanded across the North American continent and acquired a number of
    overseas possessions. The two most traumatic experiences in the
    nation's history were the Civil War (1861-65), in which a northern
    Union of states defeated a secessionist Confederacy of 11 southern
    slave states, and the Great Depression of the 1930s, an economic
    downturn during which about a quarter of the labor force lost its jobs.
    Buoyed by victories in World Wars I and II and the end of the Cold War
    in 1991, the US remains the world's most powerful nation state. Since
    the end of World War II, the economy has achieved relatively steady
    growth, low unemployment and inflation, and rapid advances in
    technology.

    part of Cuba; the base boundary is 28 km

  Coastline:
    19,924 km

  Maritime claims:
    territorial sea: 12 nm
    contiguous zone: 24 nm
    exclusive economic zone: 200 nm
    continental shelf: not specified

  Climate:
    mostly temperate, but tropical in Hawaii and Florida, arctic in Alaska,
    semiarid in the great plains west of the Mississippi River, and arid in
    the Great Basin of the southwest; low winter temperatures in the
    northwest are ameliorated occasionally in January and February by warm
    chinook winds from the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains

  Terrain:
    vast central plain, mountains in west, hills and low mountains in east;
    rugged mountains and broad river valleys in Alaska; rugged, volcanic
    topography in Hawaii

  Elevation extremes:
    lowest point: Death Valley -86 m
    highest point: Mount McKinley (Denali) 6,194 m (highest point in North
    America)
    note: the peak of Mauna Kea (4,207 m above sea level) on the island of
    Hawaii rises about 10,200 m above the Pacific Ocean floor; by this
    measurement, it is the world's tallest mountain - higher than Mount
    Everest (8,850 m), which is recognized as the tallest mountain above
    sea level

  Natural resources:
    coal, copper, lead, molybdenum, phosphates, rare earth elements,
    uranium, bauxite, gold, iron, mercury, nickel, potash, silver,
    tungsten, zinc, petroleum, natural gas, timber

    short tons accounting for 27% of the world's total

  Land use:
    arable land: 16.29%
    permanent crops: 0.26%
    other: 83.44% (2011)

    total: 478.4 cu km/yr (14%/46%/40%)
    per capita: 1,583 cu m/yr (2005)

  Natural hazards:
    tsunamis; volcanoes; earthquake activity around Pacific Basin;
    hurricanes along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts; tornadoes in
    the Midwest and Southeast; mud slides in California; forest fires in
    the west; flooding; permafrost in northern Alaska, a major impediment
    to development
    volcanism: volcanic activity in the Hawaiian Islands, Western Alaska,
    the Pacific Northwest, and in the Northern Mariana Islands; both Mauna
    Loa (elev. 4,170 m) in Hawaii and Mount Rainier (elev. 4,392 m) in
    Washington have been deemed Decade Volcanoes by the International
    Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior,
    worthy of study due to their explosive history and close proximity to
    human populations; Pavlof (elev. 2,519 m) is the most active volcano in
    Alaska's Aleutian Arc and poses a significant threat to air travel
    since the area constitutes a major flight path between North America
    and East Asia; St. Helens (elev. 2,549 m), famous for the devastating
    1980 eruption, remains active today; numerous other historically active
    volcanoes exist, mostly concentrated in the Aleutian arc and Hawaii;
    they include: in Alaska: Aniakchak, Augustine, Chiginagak, Fourpeaked,
    Iliamna, Katmai, Kupreanof, Martin, Novarupta, Redoubt, Spurr,
    Wrangell; in Hawaii: Trident, Ugashik-Peulik, Ukinrek Maars,
    Veniaminof; in the Northern Mariana Islands: Anatahan; and in the
    Pacific Northwest: Mount Baker, Mount Hood

  Environment - current issues:
    air pollution resulting in acid rain in both the US and Canada; large
    emitter of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels; water
    pollution from runoff of pesticides and fertilizers; limited natural
    freshwater resources in much of the western part of the country require
    careful management; desertification

  Environment - international agreements:

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    The US has the largest and most technologically powerful economy in the
    world, with a per capita GDP of $49,800. In this market-oriented
    economy, private individuals and business firms make most of the
    decisions, and the federal and state governments buy needed goods and
    services predominantly in the private marketplace. US business firms
    enjoy greater flexibility than their counterparts in Western Europe and
    Japan in decisions to expand capital plant, to lay off surplus workers,
    and to develop new products. At the same time, they face higher
    barriers to enter their rivals' home markets than foreign firms face
    entering US markets. US firms are at or near the forefront in
    technological advances, especially in computers and in medical,
    aerospace, and military equipment; their advantage has narrowed since
    the end of World War II. The onrush of technology largely explains the
    gradual development of a "two-tier labor market" in which those at the
    bottom lack the education and the professional/technical skills of
    those at the top and, more and more, fail to get comparable pay raises,
    health insurance coverage, and other benefits. Since 1975, practically
    all the gains in household income have gone to the top 20% of
    households. Since 1996, dividends and capital gains have grown faster
    than wages or any other category of after-tax income. Imported oil
    accounts for nearly 55% of US consumption. Crude oil prices doubled
    between 2001 and 2006, the year home prices peaked; higher gasoline
    prices ate into consumers' budgets and many individuals fell behind in
    their mortgage payments. Oil prices climbed another 50% between 2006
    and 2008, and bank foreclosures more than doubled in the same period.
    Besides dampening the housing market, soaring oil prices caused a drop
    in the value of the dollar and a deterioration in the US merchandise
    trade deficit, which peaked at $840 billion in 2008. The sub-prime
    mortgage crisis, falling home prices, investment bank failures, tight
    credit, and the global economic downturn pushed the United States into
    a recession by mid-2008. GDP contracted until the third quarter of
    2009, making this the deepest and longest downturn since the Great
    Depression. To help stabilize financial markets, in October 2008 the US
    Congress established a $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program
    (TARP). The government used some of these funds to purchase equity in
    US banks and industrial corporations, much of which had been returned
    to the government by early 2011. In January 2009 the US Congress passed
    and President Barack OBAMA signed a bill providing an additional $787
    billion fiscal stimulus to be used over 10 years - two-thirds on
    additional spending and one-third on tax cuts - to create jobs and to
    help the economy recover. In 2010 and 2011, the federal budget deficit
    reached nearly 9% of GDP. In 2012 the federal government reduced the
    growth of spending and the deficit shrank to 7.6% of GDP. Wars in Iraq
    and Afghanistan required major shifts in national resources from
    civilian to military purposes and contributed to the growth of the
    budget deficit and public debt. Through 2011, the direct costs of the
    wars totaled nearly $900 billion, according to US government figures.
    US revenues from taxes and other sources are lower, as a percentage of
    GDP, than those of most other countries. In March 2010, President OBAMA
    signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a
    health insurance reform that was designed to extend coverage to an
    additional 32 million American citizens by 2016, through private health
    insurance for the general population and Medicaid for the impoverished.
    Total spending on health care - public plus private - rose from 9.0% of
    GDP in 1980 to 17.9% in 2010. In July 2010, the president signed the
    DODD-FRANK Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a law
    designed to promote financial stability by protecting consumers from
    financial abuses, ending taxpayer bailouts of financial firms, dealing
    with troubled banks that are "too big to fail," and improving
    accountability and transparency in the financial system - in
    particular, by requiring certain financial derivatives to be traded in
    markets that are subject to government regulation and oversight. In
    December 2012, the Federal Reserve Board (Fed) announced plans to
    purchase $85 billion per month of mortgage-backed and Treasury
    securities in an effort to hold down long-term interest rates, and to
    keep short term rates near zero until unemployment drops below 6.5% or
    inflation rises above 2.5%. In late 2013, the Fed announced that it
    would begin scaling back long-term bond purchases to $75 billion per
    month in January 2014 and reduce them further as conditions warranted;
    the Fed, however, would keep short-term rates near zero so long as
    unemployment and inflation had not crossed the previously stated
    thresholds. Long-term problems include stagnation of wages for
    lower-income families, inadequate investment in deteriorating
    infrastructure, rapidly rising medical and pension costs of an aging
