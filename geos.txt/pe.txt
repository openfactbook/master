Introduction

  Background:
    Ancient Peru was the seat of several prominent Andean civilizations,
    most notably that of the Incas whose empire was captured by Spanish
    conquistadors in 1533. Peruvian independence was declared in 1821, and
    remaining Spanish forces were defeated in 1824. After a dozen years of
    military rule, Peru returned to democratic leadership in 1980, but
    experienced economic problems and the growth of a violent insurgency.
    President Alberto FUJIMORI's election in 1990 ushered in a decade that
    saw a dramatic turnaround in the economy and significant progress in
    curtailing guerrilla activity. Nevertheless, the president's increasing
    reliance on authoritarian measures and an economic slump in the late
    1990s generated mounting dissatisfaction with his regime, which led to
    his resignation in 2000. A caretaker government oversaw new elections
    in the spring of 2001, which installed Alejandro TOLEDO Manrique as the
    new head of government - Peru's first democratically elected president
    of indigenous ethnicity. The presidential election of 2006 saw the
    return of Alan GARCIA Perez who, after a disappointing presidential
    term from 1985 to 1990, oversaw a robust economic rebound. In June
    2011, former army officer Ollanta HUMALA Tasso was elected president,
    defeating Keiko FUJIMORI Higuchi, the daughter of Alberto FUJIMORI.
    Since his election, HUMALA has carried on the sound, market-oriented
    economic policies of the three preceding administrations.

  Demographic profile:
    Peru's urban and coastal communities have benefited much more from
    recent economic growth than rural, Afro-Peruvian, indigenous, and poor
    populations of the Amazon and mountain regions. The poverty rate has
    dropped substantially during the last decade but remains stubbornly
    high at about 30% (more than 55% in rural areas). After remaining
    almost static for about a decade, Peru's malnutrition rate began
    falling in 2005, when the government introduced a coordinated strategy
    focusing on hygiene, sanitation, and clean water. School enrollment has
    improved, but achievement scores reflect ongoing problems with
    educational quality. Many poor children temporarily or permanently drop
    out of school to help support their families. About a quarter to a
    third of Peruvian children aged 6 to 14 work, often putting in long
    hours at hazardous mining or construction sites.
    Peru was a country of immigration in the 19th and early 20th centuries,
    but has become a country of emigration in the last few decades.
    Beginning in the 19th century, Peru brought in Asian contract laborers
    mainly to work on coastal plantations. Populations of Chinese and
    Japanese descent - among the largest in Latin America - are
    economically and culturally influential in Peru today. Peruvian
    emigration began rising in the 1980s due to an economic crisis and a
    violent internal conflict, but outflows have stabilized in the last few
    years as economic conditions have improved. Nonetheless, more than 2
    million Peruvians have emigrated in the last decade, principally to the
    US, Spain, and Argentina.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Peru's economy reflects its varied topography - an arid lowland coastal
    region, the central high sierra of the Andes, the dense forest of the
    Amazon, with tropical lands bordering Colombia and Brazil. A wide range
    of important mineral resources are found in the mountainous and coastal
    areas, and Peru's coastal waters provide excellent fishing grounds.
    Peru is the world's second largest producer of silver and third largest
    producer of copper. The Peruvian economy has been growing by an average
    of 5.6% for the past five years with a stable exchange rate and low
    inflation, which in 2013 was just below the upper limit of the Central
    Bank target range of 1 to 3%. For the last three years, this growth was
    due partly to high international prices for Peru's metals and minerals
    exports, which account for almost 60% of the country's total exports.
    Despite Peru's strong macroeconomic performance, dependence on minerals
    and metals exports and imported foodstuffs makes the economy vulnerable
    to fluctuations in world prices. Peru's rapid expansion coupled with
    cash transfers and other programs have helped to reduce the national
    poverty rate by 28 percentage points since 2002, but inequality
    persists and continues to pose a challenge for the Ollanta HUMALA
    administration, which has championed a policy of social inclusion and a
    more equitable distribution of income. Poor infrastructure hinders the
    spread of growth to Peru's non-coastal areas. Peru's free trade policy
    has continued under the HUMALA administration; since 2006, Peru has
    signed trade deals with the US, Canada, Singapore, China, Korea,
    Mexico, Japan, the EU, the European Free Trade Association, Chile,
    Thailand, Costa Rica, Panama, Venezuela, concluded negotiations with
    Guatemala, and begun trade talks with Honduras and El Salvador, Turkey
    and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Peru also has signed a trade pact
    with Chile, Colombia, and Mexico, called the Pacific Alliance, that
    rivals Mercosur. Since the US-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement entered
    into force in February 2009, total trade between Peru and the United
    States has doubled. Although Peru has continued to attract foreign
    investment, political activism and protests are hampering development
    of some projects related to natural resource extraction.

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:

    organized illegal narcotics operations in Colombia have penetrated
    Peru's shared border; Peru rejects Bolivia's claim to restore maritime
    access through a sovereign corridor through Chile along the Peruvian
    border

  Refugees and internally displaced persons:
    IDPs: 150,000 (civil war from 1980-2000; most IDPs are indigenous
    peasants in Andean and Amazonian regions; as of 2011, no new
    information on the situation of these IDPs) (2013 est.)

  Illicit drugs:
    until 1996 the world's largest coca leaf producer, Peru is now the
    world's second largest producer of coca leaf, though it lags far behind
    Colombia; cultivation of coca in Peru was estimated at 40,000 hectares
    in 2009, a slight decrease over 2008; second largest producer of
    cocaine, estimated at 225 metric tons of potential pure cocaine in
    2009; finished cocaine is shipped out from Pacific ports to the
    international drug market; increasing amounts of base and finished
    cocaine, however, are being moved to Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and
    Bolivia for use in the Southern Cone or transshipment to Europe and
    Africa; increasing domestic drug consumption
