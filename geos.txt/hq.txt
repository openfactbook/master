Howland Island
==============

(territory of the US)


Introduction

  Background:
    Discovered by the US early in the 19th century, the island was
    officially claimed by the US in 1857. Both US and British companies
    mined for guano until about 1890. Earhart Light is a day beacon near
    the middle of the west coast that was partially destroyed during World
    War II, but subsequently rebuilt; it is named in memory of the famed
    aviatrix Amelia EARHART. The island is administered by the US
    Department of the Interior as a National Wildlife Refuge.
