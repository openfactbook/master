Introduction

  Background:
    In 1865, Britain and Bhutan signed the Treaty of Sinchulu, under which
    Bhutan would receive an annual subsidy in exchange for ceding some
    border land to British India. Under British influence, a monarchy was
    set up in 1907; three years later, a treaty was signed whereby the
    British agreed not to interfere in Bhutanese internal affairs, and
    Bhutan allowed Britain to direct its foreign affairs. This role was
    assumed by independent India after 1947. Two years later, a formal
    Indo-Bhutanese accord returned to Bhutan the areas annexed by the
    British, formalized the annual subsidies the country received, and
    defined India's responsibilities in defense and foreign relations. In
    March 2005, King Jigme Singye WANGCHUCK unveiled the government's draft
    constitution - which introduced major democratic reforms - and pledged
    to hold a national referendum for its approval. In December 2006, the
    King abdicated the throne in favor of his son, Jigme Khesar Namgyel
    WANGCHUCK, in order to give him experience as head of state before the
    democratic transition. In early 2007, India and Bhutan renegotiated
    their treaty, eliminating the clause that stated that Bhutan would be
    "guided by" India in conducting its foreign policy, although Thimphu
    continues to coordinate closely with New Delhi. Elections for seating
    the country's first parliament were completed in March 2008; the king
    ratified the country's first constitution in July 2008. Bhutan
    experienced a peaceful turnover of power following parliamentary
    elections in 2013, which routed the incumbent party. The disposition of
    some 30,000 Bhutanese refugees - housed in two UN refugee camps in
    Nepal - remains unresolved.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Bhutan's economy, small and less developed, is based largely on
    agriculture and forestry, which provide the main livelihood for more
    than half of the population. Because rugged mountains dominate the
    terrain and make the building of roads and other infrastructure
    difficult and expensive, industrial production is primarily of the
    cottage industry type. The economy is closely aligned with India's
    through strong trade and monetary links and is dependent on India for
    financial assistance and migrant laborers for development projects,
    especially for road construction. Multilateral development
    organizations administer most educational, social, and environment
    programs, and take into account the government's desire to protect the
    country's environment and cultural traditions. For example, the
    government, in its cautious expansion of the tourist sector, encourages
    visits by upscale, environmentally conscientious tourists. Complicated
    controls and uncertain policies in areas such as industrial licensing,
    trade, labor, and finance continue to hamper foreign investment.
    Bhutan’s largest export - hydropower to India - is creating
    employment and will probably sustain growth in the coming years. Only
    5% of Bhutan’s 30,000 megawatt hydropower potential is currently
    tapped. The large amount of equipment needed to import materials to
    build hydropower plants has expanded Bhutan's trade and current account
    deficits. Bhutan’s GDP has rebounded strongly since the global
    recession began in 2008. Bhutan hopes to play a larger role in regional
    economic integration as a member of the South Asia Association for
    Regional Cooperation and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for
    Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation.
