Introduction

  Background:
    Burundi's first democratically elected president was assassinated in
    October 1993 after only 100 days in office, triggering widespread
    ethnic violence between Hutu and Tutsi factions. More than 200,000
    Burundians perished during the conflict that spanned almost a dozen
    years. Hundreds of thousands of Burundians were internally displaced or
    became refugees in neighboring countries. An internationally brokered
    power-sharing agreement between the Tutsi-dominated government and the
    Hutu rebels in 2003 paved the way for a transition process that led to
    an integrated defense force, established a new constitution in 2005,
    and elected a majority Hutu government in 2005. The government of
    President Pierre NKURUNZIZA, who was reelected in 2010, continues to
    face many political and economic challenges.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Burundi is a landlocked, resource-poor country with an underdeveloped
    manufacturing sector. The economy is predominantly agricultural;
    agriculture accounts for just over 30% of GDP and employs more than 90%
    of the population. Burundi's primary exports are coffee and tea, which
    account for 90% of foreign exchange earnings, though exports are a
    relatively small share of GDP. Burundi's export earnings - and its
    ability to pay for imports - rests primarily on weather conditions and
    international coffee and tea prices. An ethnic-based war that lasted
    for over a decade resulted in more than 200,000 deaths, forced more
    than 48,000 refugees into Tanzania, and displaced 140,000 others
    internally. Only one in two children go to school, and approximately
    one in 15 adults has HIV/AIDS. Food, medicine, and electricity remain
    in short supply. Less than 2% of the population has electricity in its
    homes. Burundi's GDP grew around 4% annually in 2006-13. Political
    stability and the end of the civil war have improved aid flows and
    economic activity has increased, but underlying weaknesses - a high
    poverty rate, poor education rates, a weak legal system, a poor
    transportation network, overburdened utilities, and low administrative
    capacity - risk undermining planned economic reforms. The purchasing
    power of most Burundians has decreased as wage increases have not kept
    up with inflation. Burundi will remain heavily dependent on aid from
    bilateral and multilateral donors - foreign aid represents 42% of
    Burundi's national income, the second highest rate in Sub-Saharan
    Africa. Burundi joined the East African Community in 2009. Government
    corruption is hindering the development of a healthy private sector as
    companies seek to navigate an environment with ever changing rules.

    persist among Tutsi, Hutu, other ethnic groups, associated political
    rebels, armed gangs, and various government forces in the Great Lakes
    region

  Refugees and internally displaced persons:
    refugees (country of origin): 45,124 (Democratic Republic of the Congo)
    (2013)

  Trafficking in persons:
    current situation: Burundi is a source country for children and

    people recruit Burundian girls for prostitution domestically, as well
    as in Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, and the Middle East, and recruit boys and
    girls for forced labor in Burundi and Tanzania; children and young
    adults are coerced into forced labor in farming, mining, construction,
    or informal commerce; some family members, friends, and neighbors are
    complicit in exploiting children, luring them in with offers of
    educational or job opportunities
