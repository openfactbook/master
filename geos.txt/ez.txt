Czech Republic
==============


Introduction

  Background:
    At the close of World War I, the Czechs and Slovaks of the former
    Austro-Hungarian Empire merged to form Czechoslovakia. During the
    interwar years, having rejected a federal system, the new country's
    predominantly Czech leaders were frequently preoccupied with meeting
    the increasingly strident demands of other ethnic minorities within the
    republic, most notably the Slovaks, the Sudeten Germans, and the
    Ruthenians (Ukrainians). On the eve of World War II, Nazi Germany
    occupied the territory that today comprises the Czech Republic and
    Slovakia became an independent state allied with Germany. After the
    war, a reunited but truncated Czechoslovakia (less Ruthenia) fell
    within the Soviet sphere of influence. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw
    Pact troops ended the efforts of the country's leaders to liberalize
    communist rule and create "socialism with a human face," ushering in a
    period of repression known as "normalization." The peaceful "Velvet
    Revolution" swept the Communist Party from power at the end of 1989 and
    inaugurated a return to democratic rule and a market economy. On 1
    January 1993, the country underwent a nonviolent "velvet divorce" into
    its two national components, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Czech
    Republic joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    The Czech Republic is a stable and prosperous market economy closely
    integrated with the EU, especially since the country's EU accession in
    2004. The auto industry is the largest single industry, and, together
    with its upstream suppliers, accounts for nearly 24% of Czech
    manufacturing. The Czech Republic produced more than a million cars for
    the first time in 2010, over 80% of which were exported. While the
    conservative, inward-looking Czech financial system has remained
    relatively healthy, the small, open, export-driven Czech economy
    remains sensitive to changes in the economic performance of its main
    export markets, especially Germany. When Western Europe and Germany
    fell into recession in late 2008, demand for Czech goods plunged,
    leading to double digit drops in industrial production and exports. As
    a result, real GDP fell sharply in 2009. The economy slowly recovered
    in the second half of 2009 and registered weak growth in the next two
    years. In 2012, however, the economy fell into a recession again, due
    both to a slump in external demand and to the government’s austerity
    measures. The country pulled out of recession in the second half of
    2013, and most analysts expect modest, but steady, growth through 2014.
    Foreign and domestic businesses alike voice concerns about corruption,
    especially in public procurement. Other long term challenges include
    dealing with a rapidly aging population, funding an unsustainable
    pension and health care system, and diversifying away from
    manufacturing and toward a more high-tech, services-based, knowledge
    economy.

    general assessment: privatization and modernization of the Czech
    telecommunication system got a late start but is advancing steadily;

    fiber-optic cable and microwave radio relay
    domestic: access to the fixed-line telephone network expanded
    throughout the 1990s but the number of fixed line connections has been
    dropping since then; mobile telephone usage increased sharply beginning
    in the mid-1990s and the number of cellular telephone subscriptions now
    greatly exceeds the population
