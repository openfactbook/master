Bulgaria
========


Introduction

  Background:
    The Bulgars, a Central Asian Turkic tribe, merged with the local Slavic
    inhabitants in the late 7th century to form the first Bulgarian state.
    In succeeding centuries, Bulgaria struggled with the Byzantine Empire
    to assert its place in the Balkans, but by the end of the 14th century
    the country was overrun by the Ottoman Turks. Northern Bulgaria
    attained autonomy in 1878 and all of Bulgaria became independent from
    the Ottoman Empire in 1908. Having fought on the losing side in both
    World Wars, Bulgaria fell within the Soviet sphere of influence and
    became a People's Republic in 1946. Communist domination ended in 1990,
    when Bulgaria held its first multiparty election since World War II and
    began the contentious process of moving toward political democracy and
    a market economy while combating inflation, unemployment, corruption,
    and crime. The country joined NATO in 2004 and the EU in 2007.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Bulgaria, a former Communist country that entered the EU on 1 January
    2007, averaged more than 6% annual growth from 2004 to 2008, driven by
    significant amounts of bank lending, consumption, and foreign direct
    investment. Successive governments have demonstrated a commitment to
    economic reforms and responsible fiscal planning, but the global
    downturn sharply reduced domestic demand, exports, capital inflows, and
    industrial production. GDP contracted by 5.5% in 2009, and has been
    slow to recover in the years since. Despite having a favorable
    investment regime, including low, flat corporate income taxes,
    significant challenges remain. Corruption in public administration, a
    weak judiciary, and the presence of organized crime continue to hamper
    the country's investment climate and economic prospects.
