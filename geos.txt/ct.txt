Central African Republic
========================


Introduction

  Background:
    The former French colony of Ubangi-Shari became the Central African
    Republic upon independence in 1960. After three tumultuous decades of
    misrule - mostly by military governments - civilian rule was
    established in 1993 and lasted for one decade. In March, 2003 President
    Ange-Felix PATASSE was deposed in a military coup led by General
    Francois BOZIZE, who established a transitional government. Elections
    held in 2005 affirmed General BOZIZE as president; he was reelected in
    2011 in voting widely viewed as flawed. The government still does not
    fully control the countryside, where pockets of lawlessness persist.
    The militant group the Lord's Resistance Army continues to destabilize
    southeastern Central African Republic, and several rebel groups joined
    together in early December 2012 to launch a series of attacks that left
    them in control of numerous towns in the northern and central parts of
    the country. The rebels - who are unhappy with BOZIZE's government -
    participated in peace talks in early January 2013 which resulted in a
    coalition government including the rebellion's leadership. In March
    2013, the coalition government dissolved, rebels seized the capital,
    and President BOZIZE fled the country. Rebel leader Michel DJOTODIA
    assumed the presidency, reappointed Nicolas TIANGAYE as Prime Minister,
    and established a transitional government on 31 March. On 13 April
    2013, the National Transitional Council affirmed DJOTODIA as President.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Subsistence agriculture, together with forestry and mining, remains the
    backbone of the economy of the Central African Republic (CAR), with
    about 60% of the population living in outlying areas. The agricultural
    sector generates more than half of GDP. Timber and diamonds account for
    most export earnings, followed by cotton. Important constraints to
    economic development include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor
    transportation system, a largely unskilled work force, and a legacy of
    misdirected macroeconomic policies. Factional fighting between the
    government and its opponents remains a drag on economic revitalization.
    Since 2009 the IMF has worked closely with the government to institute
    reforms that have resulted in some improvement in budget transparency,
    but other problems remain. The government's additional spending in the
    run-up to the election in 2011 worsened CAR's fiscal situation.
    Distribution of income is extraordinarily unequal. Grants from France
    and the international community can only partially meet humanitarian
    needs. In 2012 the World Bank approved $125 million in funding for
    transport infrastructure and regional trade, focused on the route
    between CAR's capital and the port of Douala in Cameroon. After a two
    year lag in donor support, the IMF's first review of CAR's extended
    credit facility for 2012-15 praised improvements in revenue collection
    but warned of weak management of spending.

  Trafficking in persons:

    destination country for children subjected to forced labor and sex
    trafficking and possibly women subjected to forced prostitution; most
    victims appear to be CAR citizens exploited within the country, and
    that a smaller number are transported back and forth between the CAR
    and Cameroon, Chad, Nigeria, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic
    of the Congo, Sudan, and South Sudan; children are forced into domestic
    servitude, commercial sexual exploitation, agricultural labor, mining,
    and street vending; armed groups operating in the CAR, including the
    Lord's Resistance Army, continue to recruit and use children for
    military activities, while village self-defense units use children as
    combatants, lookouts, and porters
