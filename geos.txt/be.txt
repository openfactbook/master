Introduction

  Background:
    Belgium became independent from the Netherlands in 1830; it was
    occupied by Germany during World Wars I and II. The country prospered
    in the past half century as a modern, technologically advanced European
    state and member of NATO and the EU. Political divisions between the
    Dutch-speaking Flemings of the north and the French-speaking Walloons
    of the south have led in recent years to constitutional amendments
    granting these regions formal recognition and autonomy. Its capital,
    Brussels, is home to numerous international organizations including the
    EU and NATO.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    This modern, open, and private-enterprise-based economy has capitalized
    on its central geographic location, highly developed transport network,
    and diversified industrial and commercial base. Industry is
    concentrated mainly in the more heavily-populated region of Flanders in
    the north. With few natural resources, Belgium imports substantial
    quantities of raw materials and exports a large volume of manufactures,
    making its economy vulnerable to volatility in world markets. Roughly
    three-quarters of Belgium's trade is with other EU countries, and
    Belgium has benefited most from its proximity to Germany. In 2013
    Belgian GDP grew by 0.1%, the unemployment rate increased to 8.8% from
    7.6% the previous year, and the government reduced the budget deficit
    from a peak of 6% of GDP in 2009 to 3.2%. Despite the relative
    improvement in Belgium's budget deficit, public debt hovers around 100%
    of GDP, a factor that has contributed to investor perceptions that the
    country is increasingly vulnerable to spillover from the euro-zone
    crisis. Belgian banks were severely affected by the international
    financial crisis in 2008 with three major banks receiving capital
    injections from the government, and the nationalization of the Belgian
    retail arm of a Franco-Belgian bank.
