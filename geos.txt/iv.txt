Cote d'Ivoire
=============


Introduction

  Background:
    Close ties to France following independence in 1960, the development of
    cocoa production for export, and foreign investment all made Cote
    d'Ivoire one of the most prosperous of the West African states but did
    not protect it from political turmoil. In December 1999, a military
    coup - the first ever in Cote d'Ivoire's history - overthrew the
    government. Junta leader Robert GUEI blatantly rigged elections held in
    late 2000 and declared himself the winner. Popular protest forced him
    to step aside and brought Laurent GBAGBO into power. Ivorian dissidents
    and disaffected members of the military launched a failed coup attempt
    in September 2002 that developed into a rebellion and then a civil war.
    The war ended in 2003 with a cease fire that left the country divided
    with the rebels holding the north, the government the south, and
    peacekeeping forces a buffer zone between the two. In March 2007,
    President GBAGBO and former New Forces rebel leader Guillaume SORO
    signed an agreement in which SORO joined GBAGBO's government as prime
    minister and the two agreed to reunite the country by dismantling the
    buffer zone, integrating rebel forces into the national armed forces,
    and holding elections. Difficulties in preparing electoral registers
    delayed balloting until 2010. In November 2010, Alassane Dramane
    OUATTARA won the presidential election over GBAGBO, but GBAGBO refused
    to hand over power, resulting in a five-month stand-off. In April 2011,
    after widespread fighting, GBAGBO was formally forced from office by
    armed OUATTARA supporters with the help of UN and French forces.
    Several thousand UN peacekeepers and several hundred French troops
    remain in Cote d'Ivoire to support the transition process. OUATTARA is
    focused on rebuilding the country's infrastructure and military after
    the five months of post-electoral fighting and faces ongoing threats
    from GBAGBO supporters, many of whom have sought shelter in Ghana.
    GBAGBO is in The Hague awaiting trial for crimes against humanity.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Cote d'Ivoire is heavily dependent on agriculture and related
    activities, which engage roughly two-thirds of the population. Cote
    d'Ivoire is the world's largest producer and exporter of cocoa beans
    and a significant producer and exporter of coffee and palm oil.
    Consequently, the economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in
    international prices for these products and in climatic conditions.
    Cocoa, oil, and coffee are the country's top export revenue earners,
    but the country is also producing gold. The country also produces oil
    and boasted two offshore oil finds in 2012. Since the end of the civil
    war in 2003, political turmoil has continued to damage the economy,
    resulting in the loss of foreign investment and slow economic growth.
    In June 2012, the IMF and the World Bank announced $4.4 billion in debt
    relief for Cote d'Ivoire under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries
    Initiative. Cote d'Ivoire's long-term challenges include political
    instability and degrading infrastructure.

    fiber-optics; 90% digitalized
    domestic: with multiple mobile-cellular service providers competing in
    the market, usage has increased sharply to roughly 80 per 100 persons
    international: country code - 225; landing point for the SAT-3/WASC

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    disputed maritime border between Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana

  Refugees and internally displaced persons:
    IDPs: at least 70,000 (post-election conflict in 2010-2011, as well as
    civil war from 2002-2004; most pronounced in western and southwestern
    regions) (2013)
    stateless persons: 700,000 (2012); note - many Ivoirians lack
    documentation proving their nationality, which prevent them from
    accessing education and healthcare; birth on Ivorian soil does not
    automatically result in citizenship; disputes over citizenship and the
    associated rights of the large population descended from migrants from
    neighboring countries is an ongoing source of tension and contributed
    to the country's 2002 civil war; some observers believe the
    government's mass naturalizations of thousands of people over the last
    couple of years is intended to boost its electoral support base; the
    government in October 2013 acceded to international conventions on
    statelessness and in August 2013 reformed its nationality law, key
    steps to clarify the nationality of thousands of residents

  Illicit drugs:
    illicit producer of cannabis, mostly for local consumption; utility as
    a narcotic transshipment point to Europe reduced by ongoing political
    instability; while rampant corruption and inadequate supervision leave
    the banking system vulnerable to money laundering, the lack of a
    developed financial system limits the country's utility as a major
    money-laundering center (2008)
