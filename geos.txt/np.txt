Introduction

  Background:
    In 1951, the Nepali monarch ended the century-old system of rule by
    hereditary premiers and instituted a cabinet system of government.
    Reforms in 1990 established a multiparty democracy within the framework
    of a constitutional monarchy. An insurgency led by Maoists broke out in
    1996. The ensuing 10-year civil war between Maoist and government
    forces witnessed the dissolution of the cabinet and parliament and
    assumption of absolute power by the king in 2002. Several weeks of mass
    protests in April 2006 were followed by several months of peace
    negotiations between the Maoists and government officials, and
    culminated in a late 2006 peace accord and the promulgation of an
    interim constitution. Following a nationwide election in April 2008,
    the newly formed Constituent Assembly (CA) declared Nepal a federal
    democratic republic and abolished the monarchy at its first meeting the
    following month. The CA elected the country's first president in July.
    Between 2008 and 2011 there were four different coalition governments,
    led twice by the United Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist, which received
    a plurality of votes in the 2008 CA election, and twice by the
    Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist-Leninist (UML). After the CA
    failed to draft a constitution by the May 2012 deadline set by the
    Supreme Court, then Prime Minister Baburam BHATTARAI dissolved the CA.
    Months of negotiations ensued until March 2013 when the major political
    parties agreed to create an interim government headed by then Chief
    Justice Khil Raj REGMI with a mandate to hold elections for a new CA.
    Elections were held in November 2013, in which and the Nepali Congress
    won the largest share of the seats in the CA and in February 2014
    formed a coalition government with the second place UML and with Nepali
    Congress President Sushil KOIRALA as prime minister

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries in the world,
    with about one-quarter of its population living below the poverty line.
    Nepal is heavily dependent on remittances, which amount to as much as
    22-25% of GDP. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a
    livelihood for more than 70% of the population and accounting for a
    little over one-third of GDP. Industrial activity mainly involves the
    processing of agricultural products, including pulses, jute, sugarcane,
    tobacco, and grain. Nepal has considerable scope for exploiting its
    potential in hydropower, with an estimated 42,000 MW of commercially
    feasible capacity, but political uncertainty and a difficult business
    climate have hampered foreign investment. Additional challenges to
    Nepal's growth include its landlocked geographic location, persistent
    power shortages, underdeveloped transportation infrastructure, civil
    strife and labor unrest, and its susceptibility to natural disaster.
    The lack of political consensus in the past several years has delayed
    national budgets and prevented much-needed economic reform, although
    the government passed a full budget in 2013.

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    joint border commission continues to work on contested sections of
    boundary with India, including the 400 sq km dispute over the source of
    the Kalapani River; India has instituted a stricter border regime to
    restrict transit of Maoist insurgents and illegal cross-border
    activities

  Refugees and internally displaced persons:
    refugees (country of origin): 15,0000-20,000 (Tibet/China) (2013);
    29,813 (Bhutan) (2014)
    IDPs: up to 50,000 (remaining from ten-year Maoist insurgency that
    officially ended in 2006; figure does not include people displaced
    since 2007 by inter-communal violence and insecurity in the Terai
    region) (2013)

    distributed 2.6 million citizenship certificates to the 3.4 million
    people without one; the remaining 800,000 without citizenship
    certificates are not necessarily stateless, and the UNHCR is working
    with the Nepali Government to clarify their situation; lesser numbers
    of Bhutanese Hindu refugees of Nepali origin (the Lhotsampa) who were
    stripped of Bhutanese nationality and forced to flee their country in
    the late 1980s and early 1990s - and undocumented Tibetan refugees who
    arrived in Nepal prior to the 1990s - are considered stateless
