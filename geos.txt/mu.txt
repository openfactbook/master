Introduction

  Background:
    The inhabitants of the area of Oman have long prospered on Indian Ocean
    trade. In the late 18th century, a newly established sultanate in
    Muscat signed the first in a series of friendship treaties with
    Britain. Over time, Oman's dependence on British political and military
    advisors increased, but it never became a British colony. In 1970,
    QABOOS bin Said Al-Said overthrew his father, and he has since ruled as
    sultan. His extensive modernization program has opened the country to
    the outside world while preserving the longstanding close ties with the
    UK. Oman's moderate, independent foreign policy has sought to maintain
    good relations with all Middle Eastern countries. Inspired by the
    popular uprisings that swept the Middle East and North Africa beginning
    in January 2011, some Omanis began staging marches, demonstrations, and
    sit-ins calling mostly for more jobs and economic benefits and an end
    to corruption. In response to those protester demands, QABOOS in 2011
    pledged to implement economic and political reforms, such as granting
    legislative and regulatory powers to the Majlis al-Shura and
    introducing unemployment benefits. Additionally, in August 2012, the
    Sultan announced a royal directive mandating the speedy implementation
    of a national job creation plan for thousands of public and private
    sector jobs. As part of the government's efforts to decentralize
    authority and allow greater citizen participation in local governance,
    Oman successfully conducted its first municipal council elections in
    December 2012. Announced by the Sultan in 2011, the municipal councils
    will have the power to advise the Royal Court on the needs of local
    districts across Oman's 11 governorates.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Oman is a middle-income economy that is heavily dependent on dwindling
    oil resources. Because of declining reserves and a rapidly growing
    labor force, Muscat has actively pursued a development plan that
    focuses on diversification, industrialization, and privatization, with
    the objective of reducing the oil sector's contribution to GDP to 9% by
    2020 and creating more jobs to employ the rising numbers of Omanis
    entering the workforce. Tourism and gas-based industries are key
    components of the government's diversification strategy. However,
    increases in social welfare benefits, particularly since the Arab
    Spring, will challenge the government's ability to effectively balance
    its budget if oil revenues decline. By using enhanced oil recovery
    techniques, Oman succeeded in increasing oil production, giving the
    country more time to diversify, and the increase in global oil prices
    through 2011 provided the government greater financial resources to
    invest in non-oil sectors. In 2012, continued surpluses resulting from
    sustained high oil prices and increased enhanced oil recovery allowed
    the government to maintain growth in social subsidies and public sector
    job creation. However, the Sultan made widely reported statements
    indicating this would not be sustainable, and called for expanded
    efforts to support SME development and entrepreneurship. Government
    agencies and large oligarchic group companies heeded his call,
    announcing new initiatives to spin off non-essential functions to
    entrepreneurs, incubate new businesses, train and mentor up and coming
    business people, and provide financing for start-ups. In response to
    fast growth in household indebtedness, the Central Bank reduced the
    ceiling on personal interest loans from 8 to 7%, lowered mortgage
    rates, capped the percentage of consumer loans at 50% of borrower's
    salaries for personal loans and 60% for housing loans, and limited
    maximum repayment terms to 10 and 25 years respectively.
