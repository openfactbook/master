Maldives
========


Introduction

  Background:
    A sultanate since the 12th century, the Maldives became a British
    protectorate in 1887. It became a republic in 1968, three years after
    independence. President Maumoon Abdul GAYOOM dominated the islands'
    political scene for 30 years, elected to six successive terms by
    single-party referendums. Following political demonstrations in the
    capital Male in August 2003, the president and his government pledged
    to embark upon a process of liberalization and democratic reforms,
    including a more representative political system and expanded political
    freedoms. Progress was sluggish, however, and many promised reforms
    were slow to be realized. Nonetheless, political parties were legalized
    in 2005. In June 2008, a constituent assembly - termed the "Special
    Majlis" - finalized a new constitution, which was ratified by the
    president in August. The first-ever presidential elections under a
    multi-candidate, multi-party system were held in October 2008. GAYOOM
    was defeated in a runoff poll by Mohamed NASHEED, a political activist
    who had been jailed several years earlier by the former regime.
    President NASHEED faced a number of challenges including strengthening
    democracy and combating poverty and drug abuse. In early February 2012,
    after several weeks of street protests following his sacking of a top
    judge, NASHEED resigned the presidency and handed over power to Vice
    President Mohammed WAHEED Hassan Maniku. In mid-2012, a Commission of
    National Inquiry was set by the government to probe events leading up
    to NASHEED's resignation. Though the commission found no evidence of a
    coup, the report recommended the need to strengthen the country's
    democratic institutions to avert similar events in the future, and to
    further investigate alleged police misconduct during the crisis.
    Maldivian officials have played a prominent role in international
    climate change discussions (due to the islands' low elevation and the
    threat from sea-level rise) on the UN Human Rights Council and in other
    international forums, as well as in encouraging regional cooperation,
    especially between India and Pakistan.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Tourism, Maldives' largest economic activity, accounts for nearly 30%
    of GDP and more than 60% of foreign exchange receipts. Fishing is the
    second leading sector, but the fish catch has dropped sharply in recent
    years. Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play a lesser role in
    the economy, constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land
    and the shortage of domestic labor. Lower than expected tourist
    arrivals and fish exports, combined with high government spending on
    social needs, subsidies, and civil servant salaries contributed to a
    balance of payments crisis, which was temporarily eased with a $79.3
    million IMF Stand-By agreement. However, after the first two
    disbursements, the IMF withheld subsequent disbursements due to
    concerns over Maldives' growing budget deficit, and the government has
    been seeking other sources of budgetary support ever since. A new Goods
    and Services Tax (GST) on tourism introduced in January 2011, on
    general goods and services in October 2011, and a new Business Profit
    Tax introduced in July 2011 have provided a boost to revenue. In recent
    years, gross foreign reserves have hovered around $300 million,
    sufficient to finance about two to three months of imports.
    Diversifying the economy beyond tourism and fishing, reforming public
    finance, increasing employment opportunities, and combating corruption,
    cronyism, and a growing drug problem are other near-term challenges
    facing the government. Over the longer term Maldivian authorities worry
    about the impact of erosion and possible global warming on their
    low-lying country; 80% of the area is 1 meter or less above sea level.
