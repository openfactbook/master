Malaysia

Introduction

  Background:
    During the late 18th and 19th centuries, Great Britain established
    colonies and protectorates in the area of current Malaysia; these were
    occupied by Japan from 1942 to 1945. In 1948, the British-ruled
    territories on the Malay Peninsula except Singapore formed the
    Federation of Malaya, which became independent in 1957. Malaysia was
    formed in 1963 when the former British colonies of Singapore, as well
    as Sabah and Sarawak on the northern coast of Borneo, joined the
    Federation. The first several years of the country's independence were
    marred by a communist insurgency, Indonesian confrontation with
    Malaysia, Philippine claims to Sabah, and Singapore's withdrawal in
    1965. During the 22-year term of Prime Minister MAHATHIR bin Mohamad
    (1981-2003), Malaysia was successful in diversifying its economy from
    dependence on exports of raw materials to the development of
    manufacturing, services, and tourism. Prime Minister Mohamed NAJIB bin
    Abdul Razak (in office since April 2009) has continued these
    pro-business policies and has introduced some civil reforms.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Malaysia, a middle-income country, has transformed itself since the
    1970s from a producer of raw materials into an emerging multi-sector
    economy. Under current Prime Minister NAJIB, Malaysia is attempting to
    achieve high-income status by 2020 and to move farther up the
    value-added production chain by attracting investments in Islamic
    finance, high technology industries, biotechnology, and services.
    NAJIB's Economic Transformation Program (ETP) is a series of projects
    and policy measures intended to accelerate the country's economic
    growth. The government has also taken steps to liberalize some services
    sub-sectors. The NAJIB administration also is continuing efforts to
    boost domestic demand and reduce the economy's dependence on exports.
    Nevertheless, exports - particularly of electronics, oil and gas, palm
    oil and rubber - remain a significant driver of the economy. As an oil
    and gas exporter, Malaysia has profited from higher world energy
    prices, although the rising cost of domestic gasoline and diesel fuel,
    combined with sustained budget deficits, has forced Kuala Lumpur to
    begin to address fiscal shortfalls, through initial reductions in
    energy and sugar subsidies and the announcement of the 2015
    implementation of a 6% goods and services tax. The government is also
    trying to lessen its dependence on state oil producer Petronas. The oil
    and gas sector supplies about 32% of government revenue in 2013. Bank
    Negara Malaysia (central bank) maintains healthy foreign exchange
    reserves, and a well-developed regulatory regime has limited Malaysia's
    exposure to riskier financial instruments and the global financial
    crisis. Nevertheless, Malaysia could be vulnerable to a fall in
    commodity prices or a general slowdown in global economic activity
    because exports are a major component of GDP. In order to attract
    increased investment, NAJIB earlier raised possible revisions to the
    special economic and social preferences accorded to ethnic Malays under
    the New Economic Policy of 1970, but retreated in 2013 after he
    encountered significant opposition from Malay nationalists and other
    vested interests. In September 2013 NAJIB launched the new Bumiputra
    Economic Empowerment Program (BEEP), policies that favor and advance
    the economic condition of ethnic Malays.

  Transportation - note:
    the International Maritime Bureau reports that the territorial and
    offshore waters in the Strait of Malacca and South China Sea remain
    high risk for piracy and armed robbery against ships; in the past,
    commercial vessels have been attacked and hijacked both at anchor and
    while underway; hijacked vessels are often disguised and cargo diverted
    to ports in East Asia; crews have been murdered or cast adrift;
    increased naval patrols since 2005 in the Strait of Malacca resulted in
    no reported incidents in 2010

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    while the 2002 "Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South
    China Sea" has eased tensions over the Spratly Islands, it is not the
    legally binding "code of conduct" sought by some parties; Malaysia was
    not party to the March 2005 joint accord among the national oil
    companies of China, the Philippines, and Vietnam on conducting marine
    seismic activities in the Spratly Islands; disputes continue over
    deliveries of fresh water to Singapore, Singapore's land reclamation,
    bridge construction, and maritime boundaries in the Johor and Singapore
    Straits; in 2008, ICJ awarded sovereignty of Pedra Branca (Pulau Batu
    Puteh/Horsburgh Island) to Singapore, and Middle Rocks to Malaysia, but
    did not rule on maritime regimes, boundaries, or disposition of South
    Ledge; land and maritime negotiations with Indonesia are ongoing, and
    disputed areas include the controversial Tanjung Datu and Camar Wulan
    border area in Borneo and the maritime boundary in the Ambalat oil
    block in the Celebes Sea; separatist violence in Thailand's
    predominantly Muslim southern provinces prompts measures to close and
    monitor border with Malaysia to stem terrorist activities; Philippines
    retains a dormant claim to Malaysia's Sabah State in northern Borneo;
    per Letters of Exchange signed in 2009, Malaysia in 2010 ceded two
    hydrocarbon concession blocks to Brunei in exchange for Brunei's sultan
    dropping claims to the Limbang corridor, which divides Brunei; piracy
    remains a problem in the Malacca Strait

  Refugees and internally displaced persons:
    refugees (country of origin): 92,287 (Burma) (2013)
    stateless persons: 40,001 (2012); note - Malaysia's stateless
    population consists of Rohingya refugees from Burma, ethnic Indians,
    and the children of Filipino and Indonesian illegal migrants; Burma
    stripped the Rohingya of their nationality in 1982; Filipino and
    Indonesian children who have not have been registered for birth
    certificates by their parents or who received birth certificates
    stamped "foreigner" are not eligible to go to government schools; these
    children are vulnerable to statelessness should they not be able to
    apply to their parents' country of origin for a passport

  Trafficking in persons:
    current situation: Malaysia is a destination and, to a lesser extent, a
    source and transit country for women and children subjected to
    conditions of forced labor and women and children subjected to sex
    trafficking; Malaysia is mainly a destination country for foreign
    workers who migrate willingly from countries including Indonesia,
    Nepal, India, Thailand, China, the Philippines, Burma, Cambodia, Laos,
    Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Vietnam but subsequently encounter forced
    labor or debt bondage at the hands of their employers in the domestic,
    agricultural, construction, plantation, and industrial sectors; a small
    number of Malaysian citizens were reportedly trafficked internally and
    abroad to Singapore, China, and Japan for commercial sexual
    exploitation; refugees are also vulnerable to trafficking; some
    officials are reportedly complicit in facilitating trafficking
    tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Malaysia does not fully comply with
    the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it
    is making significant efforts to do so; the government has made no
    tangible improvements to its inadequate system for identifying and
    protecting trafficking victims, such as amending its laws to allow
    victims to reside in NGO shelters; trafficking victims identified by
    Malaysian authorities are forcibly detained in government facilities,
    where they are provided with limited, if any, access to legal or
    psychological assistance by the government or NGOs; increasing efforts
    are being made to investigate and prosecute trafficking offenders,
    notably in the area of labor trafficking, though convictions of sex
    trafficking offenders has decreased; many front-line officials continue
    to lack the ability to recognize indicators of human trafficking,
    hindering the investigation of cases and the identification of victims;
    although the confiscation of passports by employers is illegal, the
    government has not prosecuted any employers who confiscated migrants'
    passports or travel documents or confined them to the workplace (2013)

  Illicit drugs:
    drug trafficking prosecuted vigorously and carries severe penalties;
    heroin still primary drug of abuse, but synthetic drug demand remains
    strong; continued ecstasy and methamphetamine producer for domestic
    users and, to a lesser extent, the regional drug market
