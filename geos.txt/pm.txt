Panama

Introduction

  Background:
    Explored and settled by the Spanish in the 16th century, Panama broke
    with Spain in 1821 and joined a union of Colombia, Ecuador, and
    Venezuela - named the Republic of Gran Colombia. When the latter
    dissolved in 1830, Panama remained part of Colombia. With US backing,
    Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903 and promptly signed a treaty with
    the US allowing for the construction of a canal and US sovereignty over
    a strip of land on either side of the structure (the Panama Canal
    Zone). The Panama Canal was built by the US Army Corps of Engineers
    between 1904 and 1914. In 1977, an agreement was signed for the
    complete transfer of the Canal from the US to Panama by the end of the
    century. Certain portions of the Zone and increasing responsibility
    over the Canal were turned over in the subsequent decades. With US
    help, dictator Manuel NORIEGA was deposed in 1989. The entire Panama
    Canal, the area supporting the Canal, and remaining US military bases
    were transferred to Panama by the end of 1999. In October 2006,
    Panamanians approved an ambitious plan (estimated to cost $5.3 billion)
    to expand the Canal. The project, which began in 2007 and could double
    the Canal's capacity, is expected to be completed in 2015.

  Demographic profile:
    Panama is a country of demographic and economic contrasts. It is in the
    midst of a demographic transition, characterized by steadily declining
    rates of fertility, mortality, and population growth, but disparities
    persist based on wealth, geography, and ethnicity. Panama has one of
    the fastest growing economies in Latin America and dedicates
    substantial funding to social programs, yet poverty and inequality
    remain prevalent. The indigenous population accounts for a growing
    share of Panama's poor and extreme poor, while the non-indigenous rural
    poor have been more successful at rising out of poverty through
    rural-to-urban labor migration. The government's large expenditures on
    untargeted, indirect subsidies for water, electricity, and fuel have
    been ineffective, but its conditional cash transfer program has shown
    some promise in helping to decrease extreme poverty among the
    indigenous population.
    Panama has expanded access to education and clean water, but the
    availability of sanitation and, to a lesser extent, electricity remains
    poor. The increase in secondary schooling - led by female enrollment -
    is spreading to rural and indigenous areas, which probably will help to
    alleviate poverty if educational quality and the availability of
    skilled jobs improve. Inadequate access to sanitation contributes to a
    high incidence of diarrhea in Panama's children, which is one of the
    main causes of Panama's elevated chronic malnutrition rate, especially
    among indigenous communities.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Panama's dollar-based economy rests primarily on a well-developed
    services sector that accounts for more than three-quarters of GDP.
    Services include operating the Panama Canal, logistics, banking, the
    Colon Free Zone, insurance, container ports, flagship registry, and
    tourism. Economic growth will be bolstered by the Panama Canal
    expansion project that began in 2007 and is estimated to be completed
    by 2015 at a cost of $5.3 billion - about 10-15% of current GDP. The
    expansion project will more than double the Canal's capacity, enabling
    it to accommodate ships that are too large to traverse the existing
    canal. The United States and China are the top users of the Canal.
    Panama is also constructing a metro system in Panama City, valued at
    $1.2 billion and scheduled to be completed by 2014. Panama's booming
    transportation and logistics services sectors, along with aggressive
    infrastructure development projects, have lead the economy to continued
    high growth in 2012. Foreign investment, at around 10% of GDP in both
    2011 and 2012, has continued to be a source of growth. Strong economic
    performance has not translated into broadly shared prosperity, as
    Panama has the second worst income distribution in Latin America. About
    one-fourth of the population lives in poverty; however, from 2006 to
    2012 poverty was reduced by 10 percentage points, while unemployment
    dropped from 12% to 4.5% of the labor force in 2013. The US-Panama
    Trade Promotion Agreement was approved by Congress and signed into law
    in October 2011, and entered into force in October 2012. Panama also
    achieved removal from the Organization of Economic Development's
    gray-list of tax havens by signing various double taxation treaties
    with other nations.
