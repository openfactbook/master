Djibouti

Introduction

  Background:
    The French Territory of the Afars and the Issas became Djibouti in
    1977. Hassan Gouled APTIDON installed an authoritarian one-party state
    and proceeded to serve as president until 1999. Unrest among the Afar
    minority during the 1990s led to a civil war that ended in 2001 with a
    peace accord between Afar rebels and the Somali Issa-dominated
    government. In 1999, Djibouti's first multiparty presidential elections
    resulted in the election of Ismail Omar GUELLEH as president; he was
    reelected to a second term in 2005 and extended his tenure in office
    via a constitutional amendment, which allowed him to begin a third term
    in 2011. Djibouti occupies a strategic geographic location at the
    intersection of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden and serves as an
    important shipping portal for goods entering and leaving the east
    African highlands and transshipments between Europe, the Middle East,
    and Asia. The government holds longstanding ties to France, which
    maintains a significant military presence in the country, and has
    strong ties with the United States. Djibouti hosts several thousand
    members of US armed services at US-run Camp Lemonnier.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Djibouti's economy is based on service activities connected with the
    country's strategic location as a deepwater port on the Red Sea.
    Three-fourths of Djibouti's inhabitants live in the capital city; the
    remainder are mostly nomadic herders. Scant rainfall limits crop
    production to small quantities of fruits and vegetables, and most food
    must be imported. Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for
    the region and an international transshipment and refueling center.
    Imports, exports, and re-exports - primarily of coffee from landlocked
    neighbor Ethiopia - represent 70% of port activity at Djibouti's
    container terminal. Djibouti has few natural resources and little
    industry. The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign
    assistance to help support its balance of payments and to finance
    development projects. An unemployment rate of nearly 60% continues to
    be a major problem. While inflation is not a concern, due to the fixed
    tie of the Djiboutian franc to the US dollar, the artificially high
    value of the Djiboutian franc adversely affects Djibouti's balance of
    payments. Djibouti holds foreign reserves amounting to less than six
    months of import coverage. Djibouti has experienced relatively minimal
    impact from the global economic downturn, but its reliance on
    diesel-generated electricity and imported food leave average consumers
    vulnerable to global price shocks. President GUELLEH in 2013 told
    international investors that Djibouti’s development plan is to
    increase its prominence in financial and communication sectors.

    contributed to the drop in incidents
