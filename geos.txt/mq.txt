Midway Islands
==============

(territory of the US)


Introduction

  Background:
    The US took formal possession of the islands in 1867. The laying of the
    trans-Pacific cable, which passed through the islands, brought the
    first residents in 1903. Between 1935 and 1947, Midway was used as a
    refueling stop for trans-Pacific flights. The US naval victory over a
    Japanese fleet off Midway in 1942 was one of the turning points of
    World War II. The islands continued to serve as a naval station until
    closed in 1993. Today the islands are a US National Wildlife Refuge.
    From 1996 to 2001 the refuge was open to the public; it is now
    temporarily closed.
