Introduction

  Background:
    Fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a British
    colony. Democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987
    caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the
    Indian community (descendants of contract laborers brought to the
    islands by the British in the 19th century). The coups and a 1990
    constitution that cemented native Melanesian control of Fiji led to
    heavy Indian emigration; the population loss resulted in economic
    difficulties, but ensured that Melanesians became the majority. A new
    constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable. Free and peaceful
    elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an Indo-Fijian, but a
    civilian-led coup in May 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of
    political turmoil. Parliamentary elections held in August 2001 provided
    Fiji with a democratically elected government led by Prime Minister
    Laisenia QARASE. Re-elected in May 2006, QARASE was ousted in a
    December 2006 military coup led by Commodore Voreqe BAINIMARAMA, who
    initially appointed himself acting president but in January 2007 became
    interim prime minister. Since taking power BAINIMARAMA has neutralized
    his opponents, crippled Fiji's democratic institutions, and initially
    refused to hold elections. In 2012, he promised to hold elections in
    2014.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Fiji, endowed with forest, mineral, and fish resources, is one of the
    most developed of the Pacific island economies though still with a
    large subsistence sector. Sugar exports, remittances from Fijians
    working abroad, and a growing tourist industry - with 400,000 to
    500,000 tourists annually - are the major sources of foreign exchange.
    Fiji's sugar has special access to European Union markets but will be
    harmed by the EU's decision to cut sugar subsidies. Sugar processing
    makes up one-third of industrial activity but is not efficient. Fiji's
    tourism industry was damaged by the December 2006 coup and is facing an
    uncertain recovery time. In 2007 tourist arrivals were down almost 6%,
    with substantial job losses in the service sector, and GDP dipped. The
    coup has created a difficult business climate. The EU has suspended all
    aid until the interim government takes steps toward new elections.
    Long-term problems include low investment, uncertain land ownership
    rights, and the government's inability to manage its budget. Overseas
    remittances from Fijians working in Kuwait and Iraq have decreased
    significantly. Fiji's current account deficit peaked at 23% of GDP in
    2006, and declined to less than 12% of GDP in 2013.
