Comoros
=======


Introduction

  Background:
    Comoros has endured more than 20 coups or attempted coups since gaining
    independence from France in 1975. In 1997, the islands of Anjouan and
    Moheli declared independence from Comoros. In 1999, military chief Col.
    AZALI seized power of the entire government in a bloodless coup, and
    helped negotiate the 2000 Fomboni Accords power-sharing agreement in
    which the federal presidency rotates among the three islands, and each
    island maintains its local government. AZALI won the 2002 federal
    presidential election, and each island in the archipelago elected its
    president. AZALI stepped down in 2006 and President SAMBI was elected
    to office. In 2007, Mohamed BACAR effected Anjouan's de-facto secession
    from the Union of Comoros, refusing to step down when Comoros' other
    islands held legitimate elections in July. The African Union (AU)
    initially attempted to resolve the political crisis by applying
    sanctions and a naval blockade to Anjouan, but in March 2008 the AU and
    Comoran soldiers seized the island. The island's inhabitants generally
    welcomed the move. In May 2011, Ikililou DHOININE won the presidency in
    peaceful elections widely deemed to be free and fair.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made up of three
    islands that have inadequate transportation links, a young and rapidly
    increasing population, and few natural resources. The low educational
    level of the labor force contributes to a subsistence level of economic
    activity, high unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign grants
    and technical assistance. Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and
    forestry, contributes 50% to GDP, employs 80% of the labor force, and
    provides most of the exports. Export income is heavily reliant on the
    three main crops of vanilla, cloves, and ylang-ylang; and Comoros'
    export earnings are easily disrupted by disasters such as fires. The
    country is not self-sufficient in food production; rice, the main
    staple, accounts for the bulk of imports. The government - which is
    hampered by internal political disputes - lacks a comprehensive
    strategy to attract foreign investment and is struggling to upgrade
    education and technical training, privatize commercial and industrial
    enterprises, improve health services, diversify exports, promote
    tourism, and reduce the high population growth rate. Political problems
    have inhibited growth. Remittances from 200,000 Comorans abroad help
    supplement GDP. In December 2012, IMF and the World Bank's
    International Development Association supported $176 million in debt
    relief for Comoros, resulting in a 59% reduction of its future external
    debt service over a period of 40 years.

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    claims French-administered Mayotte and challenges France's and
    Madagascar's claims to Banc du Geyser, a drying reef in the Mozambique
    Channel; in May 2008, African Union forces were called in to assist the
    Comoros military recapture Anjouan Island from rebels who seized it in
    2001

  Trafficking in persons:
    current situation: Comoros is a source country for children subjected
    to forced labor and reportedly sex trafficking; Comoran children are
    forced to labor within the country in domestic service, roadside and
    street vending, baking, agriculture, and sometimes criminal activities;
    some Comoran students at Koranic schools are exploited for forced
    agricultural or domestic labor, sometimes being subjected to physical
    and sexual abuse; Comoros may be particularly vulnerable to
    transnational trafficking because of inadequate border controls,
    government corruption, and the presence of criminal networks
