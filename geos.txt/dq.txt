Jarvis Island
=============

(territory of the US)


Introduction

  Background:
    First discovered by the British in 1821, the uninhabited island was
    annexed by the US in 1858 but abandoned in 1879 after tons of guano
    deposits had been removed for use in producing fertilizer. The UK
    annexed the island in 1889 but never carried out plans for further
    exploitation. The US occupied and reclaimed the island in 1935.
    Abandoned after World War II, the island is currently a National
    Wildlife Refuge administered by the US Department of the Interior.
