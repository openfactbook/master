Liberia
=======


Introduction

  Background:
    Settlement of freed slaves from the US in what is today Liberia began
    in 1822; by 1847, the Americo-Liberians were able to establish a
    republic. William TUBMAN, president from 1944-71, did much to promote
    foreign investment and to bridge the economic, social, and political
    gaps between the descendants of the original settlers and the
    inhabitants of the interior. In 1980, a military coup led by Samuel DOE
    ushered in a decade of authoritarian rule. In December 1989, Charles
    TAYLOR launched a rebellion against DOE's regime that led to a
    prolonged civil war in which DOE was killed. A period of relative peace
    in 1997 allowed for elections that brought TAYLOR to power, but major
    fighting resumed in 2000. An August 2003 peace agreement ended the war
    and prompted the resignation of former president Charles TAYLOR, who
    faces war crimes charges in The Hague related to his involvement in
    Sierra Leone's civil war. After two years of rule by a transitional
    government, democratic elections in late 2005 brought President Ellen
    JOHNSON SIRLEAF to power. She subsequently won reelection in 2011 in a
    second round vote that was boycotted by the opposition and remains
    challenged to build Liberia's economy and reconcile a nation still
    recovering from 14 years of fighting. The United Nations Security
    Council in September 2012 passed Resolution 2066 which calls for a
    reduction of UN troops in Liberia by half by 2015, bringing the troop
    total down to fewer than 4000, and challenging Liberia's security
    sector to fill the gaps.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Liberia is a low income country that relies heavily on foreign
    assistance. Civil war and government mismanagement destroyed much of
    Liberia's economy, especially the infrastructure in and around the
    capital, Monrovia. Many businesses fled the country, taking capital and
    expertise with them, but with the conclusion of fighting and the
    installation of a democratically elected government in 2006, several
    have returned. Liberia is richly endowed with water, mineral resources,
    forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture, and iron ore and
    rubber have driven growth in recent years. Liberia is also reviving its
    raw timber sector and is encouraging oil exploration. President JOHNSON
    SIRLEAF, a Harvard-educated banker and administrator, has taken steps
    to reduce corruption, build support from international donors, and
    encourage private investment. Rebuilding infrastructure and raising
    incomes will depend on financial and technical assistance from donor
    countries and foreign investment in key sectors, such as infrastructure
    and power generation. The country achieved high growth during 2010-13
    due to favorable world prices for its commodities. In the future,
    growth will depend on global commodity prices, on sustained foreign
    aid, trade, investment, and remittances, on the development of
    infrastructure and institutions, but mostly on maintaining political
    stability and security.

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    although civil unrest continues to abate with the assistance of 6,500
    UN Mission in Liberia peacekeepers, as of January 2013, Liberian
    refugees still remain in Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire, Sierra Leone, and
    Ghana; Liberia, in turn, shelters refugees fleeing turmoil in Cote
    d'Ivoire; despite the presence of over 9,000 UN forces in Cote d'Ivoire
    since 2004, ethnic conflict continues to spread into neighboring states
    who can no longer send their migrant workers to Ivorian cocoa
    plantations; UN sanctions ban Liberia from exporting diamonds and
    timber

  Refugees and internally displaced persons:
    refugees (country of origin): 42,026 (Cote d'Ivoire) (2014)
    IDPs: up to 23,000 (civil war from 1990-2004; post-election violence in
    March and April 2011; unclear how many have found durable solutions;
    many dwell in slums in Monrovia) (2013)

  Trafficking in persons:
    current situation: Liberia is a source, transit, and destination
    country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex
    trafficking; most victims are Liberian and are exploited within the
    country, where they are forced into domestic servitude, begging,
    prostitution, street vending, agricultural work, and diamond mining; a
    small number of Liberian men, women, and children are trafficked to
    Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and the US, while
    trafficking victims are brought to Liberia from neighboring West
    African countries, including Sierra Leone, Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire, and
    Nigeria
    tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Liberia does not fully comply with the
    minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is
    making significant efforts to do so; the government has increased its
    anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts and achieved its first
    conviction under its 2005 anti-trafficking law; the government has
    failed to make adequate efforts to identify and protect trafficking
    victims and has not adopted or implemented the standard operating
    procedures for assisting victims finalized by the anti-trafficking
    secretariat in 2012; the referral of victims to NGOs for protective
    services is inconsistent (2013)

  Illicit drugs:
    transshipment point for Southeast and Southwest Asian heroin and South
    American cocaine for the European and US markets; corruption, criminal
    activity, arms-dealing, and diamond trade provide significant potential
    for money laundering, but the lack of well-developed financial system
    limits the country's utility as a major money-laundering center
