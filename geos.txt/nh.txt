Vanuatu
=======


Introduction

  Background:
    Multiple waves of colonizers, each speaking a distinct language,
    migrated to the New Hebrides in the millennia preceding European
    exploration in the 18th century. This settlement pattern accounts for
    the complex linguistic diversity found on the archipelago to this day.
    The British and French, who settled the New Hebrides in the 19th
    century, agreed in 1906 to an Anglo-French Condominium, which
    administered the islands until independence in 1980, when the new name
    of Vanuatu was adopted.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    This South Pacific island economy is based primarily on small-scale
    agriculture, which provides a living for about two-thirds of the
    population. Fishing, offshore financial services, and tourism, with
    nearly 197,000 visitors in 2008, are other mainstays of the economy.
    Mineral deposits are negligible; the country has no known petroleum
    deposits. A small light industry sector caters to the local market. Tax
    revenues come mainly from import duties. Economic development is
    hindered by dependence on relatively few commodity exports,
    vulnerability to natural disasters, and long distances from main
    markets and between constituent islands. In response to foreign
    concerns, the government has promised to tighten regulation of its
    offshore financial center. In mid-2002, the government stepped up
    efforts to boost tourism through improved air connections, resort
    development, and cruise ship facilities. Agriculture, especially
    livestock farming, is a second target for growth. Australia and New
    Zealand are the main suppliers of tourists and foreign aid.
