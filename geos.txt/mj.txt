Montenegro
==========


Introduction

  Background:
    The use of the name Crna Gora or Black Mountain (Montenegro) began in
    the 13th century in reference to a highland region in the Serbian
    province of Zeta. The later medieval state of Zeta maintained its
    existence until 1496 when Montenegro finally fell under Ottoman rule.
    Over subsequent centuries Montenegro managed to maintain a level of
    autonomy within the Ottoman Empire. From the 16th to 19th centuries,
    Montenegro was a theocracy ruled by a series of bishop princes; in
    1852, it transformed into a secular principality. Montenegro was
    recognized as an independent sovereign principality at the Congress of
    Berlin in 1878. After World War I, during which Montenegro fought on
    the side of the Allies, Montenegro was absorbed by the Kingdom of
    Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, which became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in
    1929; at the conclusion of World War II, it became a constituent
    republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. When the
    latter dissolved in 1992, Montenegro federated with Serbia, creating
    the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and, after 2003, shifting to a
    looser State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. In May 2006, Montenegro
    invoked its right under the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and
    Montenegro to hold a referendum on independence from the state union.
    The vote for severing ties with Serbia barely exceeded 55% - the
    threshold set by the EU - allowing Montenegro to formally restore its
    independence on 3 June 2006.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Montenegro's economy is slowly transitioning to a market system, but
    the state sector remains large and additional institutional changes are
    needed. The economy relies heavily on foreign tourism and the export of
    refined metals. Unprofitable state-owned enterprises, especially the
    Podgorica Aluminum Kombine, the country’s largest exporter, weigh
    heavily on public finances. During the MILOSEVIC era, Montenegro
    severed its economy from Serbia, maintained its own central bank,
    adopted the Deutsche Mark, then shifted to the euro - rather than the
    Yugoslav dinar - as official currency, collected customs tariffs, and
    managed its own budget. The 2006 dissolution of the loose political
    union between Serbia and Montenegro led to separate memberships in
    several international financial institutions, such as the European Bank
    for Reconstruction and Development. In January 2007, Montenegro joined
    the World Bank and IMF. Montenegro became the 156th member of World
    Trade Organization in December 2011. The European Council (EC) granted
    candidate country status to Montenegro at the December 2010 session.
    Montenegro began negotiations to join the EC in June, 2012, having met
    the conditions set down by the European Council, which called on
    Montenegro to take steps to fight corruption and organized crime.
    Unemployment and disparities in regional development, especially in the
    north, remain key political and economic problems. The global financial
    crisis had a significant negative impact on the economy, due to a
    credit crunch, a decline in the real estate sector, and a fall in
    aluminum exports. The Government of Montenegro increased value added
    tax (VAT) from 17% in 2012 to 19% in 2013 and raised income tax rates
    from 9% to 15% for those earning over €480 a month. In 2013, the
    government also retrenched by freezing pensions and limiting salary
    increases for public enterprises and members of the parliament.
