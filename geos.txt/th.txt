Thailand
========


Introduction

  Background:
    A unified Thai kingdom was established in the mid-14th century. Known
    as Siam until 1939, Thailand is the only Southeast Asian country never
    to have been taken over by a European power. A bloodless revolution in
    1932 led to a constitutional monarchy. In alliance with Japan during
    World War II, Thailand became a US treaty ally in 1954 after sending
    troops to Korea and later fighting alongside the United States in
    Vietnam. Thailand since 2005 has experienced several rounds of
    political turmoil including a military coup in 2006 that ousted then
    Prime Minister THAKSIN Chinnawat, followed by large-scale street
    protests by competing political factions in 2008, 2009, and 2010.
    THAKSIN's youngest sister, YINGLAK Chinnawat, in 2011 led the Puea Thai
    Party to an electoral win and assumed control of the government. A
    blanket amnesty bill for individuals involved in street protests,
    altered at the last minute to include all political crimes - including
    all convictions against THAKSIN - triggered months of large-scale
    anti-government protests in Bangkok beginning in November 2013. In
    early May 2014 YINGLAK was removed from office and in late May 2014 the
    Royal Thai Army staged a coup against the caretaker government.
    Thailand has also experienced violence associated with the
    ethno-nationalist insurgency in Thailand's southern Malay-Muslim
    majority provinces. Since January 2004, thousands have been killed and
    wounded in the insurgency.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    With a well-developed infrastructure, a free-enterprise economy,
    generally pro-investment policies, and strong export industries,
    Thailand achieved steady growth due largely to industrial and
    agriculture exports - mostly electronics, agricultural commodities,
    automobiles and parts, and processed foods. Unemployment, at less than
    1% of the labor force, stands as one of the lowest levels in the world,
    which puts upward pressure on wages in some industries. Thailand also
    attracts nearly 2.5 million migrant workers from neighboring countries.
    The Thai government in 2013 implemented a nation-wide 300 baht ($10)
    per day minimum wage policy and deployed new tax reforms designed to
    lower rates on middle-income earners. The Thai economy has weathered
    internal and external economic shocks in recent years. The global
    economic recession severely cut Thailand's exports, with most sectors
    experiencing double-digit drops. In late 2011 Thailand's recovery was
    interrupted by historic flooding in the industrial areas in Bangkok and
    its five surrounding provinces, crippling the manufacturing sector. The
    government approved flood mitigation projects worth $11.7 billion,
    which were started in 2012, to prevent similar economic damage, and an
    additional $75 billion for infrastructure over the following seven
    years. This was expected to lead to an economic upsurge but growth has
    remained slow, in part due to ongoing political unrest and resulting
    uncertainties. Spending on infrastructure will require re-approval once
    a new government is seated.

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    separatist violence in Thailand's predominantly Malay-Muslim southern
    provinces prompt border closures and controls with Malaysia to stem
    insurgent activities; Southeast Asian states have enhanced border
    surveillance to check the spread of avian flu; talks continue on
    completion of demarcation with Laos but disputes remain over several
    islands in the Mekong River; despite continuing border committee talks,
    Thailand must deal with Karen and other ethnic rebels, refugees, and
    illegal cross-border activities; Cambodia and Thailand dispute sections
    of boundary; in 2011 Thailand and Cambodia resorted to arms in the
    dispute over the location of the boundary on the precipice surmounted
    by Preah Vihear temple ruins, awarded to Cambodia by ICJ decision in
    1962 and part of a planned UN World Heritage site; Thailand is studying
    the feasibility of jointly constructing the Hatgyi Dam on the Salween
    river near the border with Burma; in 2004, international
    environmentalist pressure prompted China to halt construction of 13
    dams on the Salween River that flows through China, Burma, and
    Thailand; 140,000 mostly Karen refugees fleeing civil strife, political
    upheaval and economic stagnation in Burma live in remote camps in
    Thailand near the border

  Refugees and internally displaced persons:
    refugees (country of origin): 78,970 (Burma) (2013)
    IDPs: up to 35,000 (resurgence in ethno-nationalist violence in south
    of country since 2004) (2013)
    stateless persons: 506,197 (2012); note - about half of Thailand's
    northern hill tribe people do not have citizenship and make up the bulk
    of Thailand's stateless population; most lack documentation showing
    they or one of their parents were born in Thailand; children born to
    Burmese refugees are not eligible for Burmese or Thai citizenship and
    are stateless; most Chao Lay, maritime nomadic peoples, who travel from
    island to island in the Andaman Sea west of Thailand are also
    stateless; stateless Rohingya refugees from Burma are considered
    illegal migrants by Thai authorities and are detained in inhumane
    conditions or expelled; stateless persons are denied access to voting,
    property, education, employment, healthcare, and driving

  Trafficking in persons:
    current situation: Thailand is a source, transit, and destination
    country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex
    trafficking; victims, who are most often from neighboring countries,
    especially Burma, and also China, Vietnam, Russia, Uzbekistan, and
    Fiji, migrate to Thailand in search of economic opportunities but are
    forced, coerced, or defrauded into labor or commercial sexual
    exploitation; forced laborers are exploited in fishing, low-end garment
    production, domestic service, and some are forced to beg; some men
    forced to work on fishing boats have reportedly been kept at sea for
    years; sex trafficking of Thai and migrant children and sex tourism
    remain significant problems; Thailand is a transit country for victims
    from North Korea, China, Vietnam, Pakistan, and Burma destined for
    exploitation in third countries, including Malaysia, Indonesia,
    Singapore, Russia, the Republic of Korea, the US, and Western European
    countries
    tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Thailand does not fully comply with
    the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; the
    government investigated more trafficking-related cases but prosecuted
    and convicted fewer trafficking offender in 2012 than it did in the
    previous year; widespread corruption among law enforcement personnel
    creates an enabling environment for human trafficking; local
    authorities lack an awareness of the elements of trafficking and are
    deficient at identifying and protecting victims; weak law enforcement,
    inadequate human and financial resources, and fragmented coordination
    among regulatory agencies in the fishing industry contributes to
    overall impunity for exploitive labor practices in this sector; no
    labor recruitment companies have been punished for forced labor or
    trafficking allegations (2013)

  Illicit drugs:
    a minor producer of opium, heroin, and marijuana; transit point for
    illicit heroin en route to the international drug market from Burma and
    Laos; eradication efforts have reduced the area of cannabis cultivation
    and shifted some production to neighboring countries; opium poppy
    cultivation has been reduced by eradication efforts; also a drug
    money-laundering center; minor role in methamphetamine production for
    regional consumption; major consumer of methamphetamine since the 1990s
    despite a series of government crackdowns
