Introduction

  Background:
    Present day Benin was the site of Dahomey, a West African kingdom that
    rose to prominence in about 1600 and over the next two and half
    centuries became a regional power, largely based on its slave trade.
    Coastal areas of Dahomey began to be controlled by the French in the
    second half of the 19th century; the entire kingdom was conquered by
    1894. French Dahomey achieved independence in 1960; it changed its name
    to the Republic of Benin in 1975. A succession of military governments
    ended in 1972 with the rise to power of Mathieu KEREKOU and the
    establishment of a government based on Marxist-Leninist principles. A
    move to representative government began in 1989. Two years later, free
    elections ushered in former Prime Minister Nicephore SOGLO as
    president, marking the first successful transfer of power in Africa
    from a dictatorship to a democracy. KEREKOU was returned to power by
    elections held in 1996 and 2001, though some irregularities were
    alleged. KEREKOU stepped down at the end of his second term in 2006 and
    was succeeded by Thomas YAYI Boni, a political outsider and
    independent. YAYI, who won a second five-year term in March 2011, has
    attempted to stem corruption and has strongly promoted accelerating
    Benin's economic growth.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and dependent on
    subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional trade. Growth
    in real output had averaged almost 4% before the global recession and
    it has returned to roughly that level in 2011-12. Inflation has
    subsided over the past several years. In order to raise growth, Benin
    plans to attract more foreign investment, place more emphasis on
    tourism, facilitate the development of new food processing systems and
    agricultural products, and encourage new information and communication
    technology. Specific projects to improve the business climate by
    reforms to the land tenure system, the commercial justice system, and
    the financial sector were included in Benin's $307 million Millennium
    Challenge Account grant signed in February 2006. The 2001 privatization
    policy continues in telecommunications, water, electricity, and
    agriculture. The Paris Club and bilateral creditors have eased the
    external debt situation with Benin benefiting from a G-8 debt reduction
    announced in July 2005, while pressing for more rapid structural
    reforms. An insufficient electrical supply continues to adversely
    affect Benin's economic growth though the government recently has taken
    steps to increase domestic power production. Private foreign direct
    investment is small, and foreign aid accounts for the majority of
    investment in infrastructure projects. Cotton, a key export, suffered
    from flooding in 2010-11, but high prices supported export earnings.
    The government agreed to a 25% increase in civil servant salaries in
    2011, following a series of strikes, increasing pressure on the
    national budget. Benin has appealed for international assistance to
    mitigate piracy against commercial shipping in its territory.
