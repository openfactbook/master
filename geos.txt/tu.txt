Introduction

  Background:
    Modern Turkey was founded in 1923 from the Anatolian remnants of the
    defeated Ottoman Empire by national hero Mustafa KEMAL, who was later
    honored with the title Ataturk or "Father of the Turks." Under his
    leadership, the country adopted wide-ranging social, legal, and
    political reforms. After a period of one-party rule, an experiment with
    multi-party politics led to the 1950 election victory of the opposition
    Democratic Party and the peaceful transfer of power. Since then,
    Turkish political parties have multiplied, but democracy has been
    fractured by periods of instability and intermittent military coups
    (1960, 1971, 1980), which in each case eventually resulted in a return
    of political power to civilians. In 1997, the military again helped
    engineer the ouster - popularly dubbed a "post-modern coup" - of the
    then Islamic-oriented government. Turkey intervened militarily on
    Cyprus in 1974 to prevent a Greek takeover of the island and has since
    acted as patron state to the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,"
    which only Turkey recognizes. A separatist insurgency begun in 1984 by
    the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) - now known as the Kurdistan
    People's Congress or Kongra-Gel (KGK) - has dominated the Turkish
    military's attention and claimed more than 30,000 lives. After the
    capture of the group's leader in 1999, the insurgents largely withdrew
    from Turkey mainly to northern Iraq. In 2013, KGK and the Turkish
    Government agreed to a ceasefire that continues despite slow progress
    in ongoing peace talks. Turkey joined the UN in 1945 and in 1952 it
    became a member of NATO. In 1964, Turkey became an associate member of
    the European Community. Over the past decade, it has undertaken many
    reforms to strengthen its democracy and economy; it began accession
    membership talks with the European Union in 2005.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Turkey's largely free-market economy is increasingly driven by its
    industry and service sectors, although its traditional agriculture
    sector still accounts for about 25% of employment. An aggressive
    privatization program has reduced state involvement in basic industry,
    banking, transport, and communication, and an emerging cadre of
    middle-class entrepreneurs is adding dynamism to the economy and
    expanding production beyond the traditional textiles and clothing
    sectors. The automotive, construction, and electronics industries are
    rising in importance and have surpassed textiles within Turkey's export
    mix. Oil began to flow through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline in May
    2006, marking a major milestone that will bring up to 1 million barrels
    per day from the Caspian to market. Several gas pipelines projects also
    are moving forward to help transport Central Asian gas to Europe
    through Turkey, which over the long term will help address Turkey's
    dependence on imported oil and gas to meet 97% of its energy needs.
    After Turkey experienced a severe financial crisis in 2001, Ankara
    adopted financial and fiscal reforms as part of an IMF program. The
    reforms strengthened the country's economic fundamentals and ushered in
    an era of strong growth averaging more than 6% annually until 2008.
    Global economic conditions and tighter fiscal policy caused GDP to
    contract in 2009, but Turkey's well-regulated financial markets and
    banking system helped the country weather the global financial crisis
    and GDP rebounded strongly to around 9% in 2010-11, as exports returned
    to normal levels following the recession. Growth dropped to roughly
    3-4% in 2012-13. Turkey's public sector debt to GDP ratio has fallen
    below 40%, and two rating agencies upgraded Turkey's debt to investment
    grade in 2012 and 2013. Turkey remains dependent on often volatile,
    short-term investment to finance its large current account deficit. The
    stock value of FDI reached nearly $195 billion at year-end 2013,
    reflecting Turkey's robust growth even in the face of economic turmoil
    in Europe, the source of much of Turkey's FDI. Turkey's relatively high
    current account deficit, domestic political uncertainty, and turmoil
    within Turkey's neighborhood leave the economy vulnerable to
    destabilizing shifts in investor confidence.

  Military - note:
    the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has actively pursued the
    goal of asserting civilian control over the military since first taking
    power in 2002; the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) role in internal security
    has been significantly reduced; the TSK leadership continues to be an
    influential institution within Turkey, but plays a much smaller role in
    politics; the Turkish military remains focused on the threats emanating
    from the Syrian civil war, Russia's actions in Ukraine, and the PKK
    insurgency; primary domestic threats are listed as fundamentalism (with
    the definition in some dispute with the civilian government),
    separatism (Kurdish discontent), and the extreme left wing; Ankara
    strongly opposed establishment of an autonomous Kurdish region in Iraq;
    an overhaul of the Turkish Land Forces Command (TLFC) taking place
    under the "Force 2014" program is to produce 20-30% smaller, more
    highly trained forces characterized by greater mobility and firepower
    and capable of joint and combined operations; the TLFC has taken on
    increasing international peacekeeping responsibilities including in
    Afghanistan; the Turkish Navy is a regional naval power that wants to
    develop the capability to project power beyond Turkey's coastal waters;
    the Navy is heavily involved in NATO, multinational, and UN operations;
    its roles include control of territorial waters and security for sea
    lines of communications; the Turkish Air Force adopted an "Aerospace
    and Missile Defense Concept" in 2002 and has initiated project work on
    an integrated missile defense system; Air Force priorities include
    attaining a modern deployable, survivable, and sustainable force
    structure, and establishing a sustainable command and control system;
    Turkey is a NATO ally and hosts NATO's Land Forces Command in Izmir, as
    well as the AN/TPY-2 radar as part of NATO Missile Defense (2014)


Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    complex maritime, air, and territorial disputes with Greece in the
    Aegean Sea; status of north Cyprus question remains; Syria and Iraq
    protest Turkish hydrological projects to control upper Euphrates
    waters; Turkey has expressed concern over the status of Kurds in Iraq;
    in 2009, Swiss mediators facilitated an accord reestablishing
    diplomatic ties between Armenia and Turkey, but neither side has
    ratified the agreement and the rapprochement effort has faltered;
    Turkish authorities have complained that blasting from quarries in
    Armenia might be damaging the medieval ruins of Ani, on the other side
    of the Arpacay valley

  Refugees and internally displaced persons:
    refugees (country of origin): 13,467 (Iraq) (2013); 783,065 (Syria)
    (2014)
    IDPs: 954,000-1.2 million (displaced from 1984-2005 because of fighting
    between Kurdish PKK and Turkish military; most IDPs are Kurds from
    eastern and southeastern provinces; no information available on persons
    displaced by development projects) (2012)
    stateless persons: 780 (2012)

  Illicit drugs:
    key transit route for Southwest Asian heroin to Western Europe and, to
    a lesser extent, the US - via air, land, and sea routes; major Turkish
    and other international trafficking organizations operate out of
    Istanbul; laboratories to convert imported morphine base into heroin
    exist in remote regions of Turkey and near Istanbul; government
    maintains strict controls over areas of legal opium poppy cultivation
    and over output of poppy straw concentrate; lax enforcement of
    money-laundering controls
