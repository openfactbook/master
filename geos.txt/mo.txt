Introduction

  Background:
    In 788, about a century after the Arab conquest of North Africa, a
    series of Moroccan Muslim dynasties began to rule in Morocco. In the
    16th century, the Sa'adi monarchy, particularly under Ahmad al-MANSUR
    (1578-1603), repelled foreign invaders and inaugurated a golden age.
    The Alaouite Dynasty, to which the current Moroccan royal family
    belongs, dates from the 17th century. In 1860, Spain occupied northern
    Morocco and ushered in a half century of trade rivalry among European
    powers that saw Morocco's sovereignty steadily erode; in 1912, the
    French imposed a protectorate over the country. A protracted
    independence struggle with France ended successfully in 1956. The
    internationalized city of Tangier and most Spanish possessions were
    turned over to the new country that same year. Sultan MOHAMMED V, the
    current monarch's grandfather, organized the new state as a
    constitutional monarchy and in 1957 assumed the title of king. Although
    Morocco is not the UN-recognized Administering Power for the Western
    Sahara, it exercises de facto administrative control over 80% of the
    territory. The UN since 1991 has monitored a ceasefire between Morocco
    and the Polisario Front and leads ongoing negotiations over the status
    of the territory. King MOHAMMED VI in early 2011 responded to the
    spread of pro-democracy protests in the region by implementing a reform
    program that included a new constitution, passed by popular referendum
    in July 2011, under which some new powers were extended to parliament
    and the prime minister but ultimate authority remains in the hands of
    the monarch. In November 2012, the Justice and Development Party - a
    moderate Islamist party - won the largest number of seats in
    parliamentary elections, becoming the first Islamist party to lead the
    Moroccan Government.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Morocco has capitalized on its proximity to Europe and relatively low
    labor costs to build a diverse, open, market-oriented economy. In the
    1980s Morocco was a heavily indebted country before pursuing austerity
    measures and pro-market reforms, overseen by the IMF. Since taking the
    throne in 1999, King MOHAMMED VI has presided over a stable economy
    marked by steady growth, low inflation, and gradually falling
    unemployment, although a poor harvest and economic difficulties in
    Europe contributed to an economic slowdown in 2012. Industrial
    development strategies and infrastructure improvements - most visibly
    illustrated by a new port and free trade zone near Tangier - are
    improving Morocco's competitiveness. Morocco also seeks to expand its
    renewable energy capacity with a goal of making renewable 40% of
    electricity output by 2020. Key sectors of the economy include
    agriculture, tourism, phosphates, textiles, apparel, and subcomponents.
    To boost exports, Morocco entered into a bilateral Free Trade Agreement
    with the United States in 2006 and an Advanced Status agreement with
    the European Union in 2008. Despite Morocco's economic progress, the
    country suffers from high unemployment, poverty, and illiteracy,
    particularly in rural areas. In 2011 and 2012, high prices on fuel -
    which is subsidized and almost entirely imported - strained the
    government's budget and widened the country's current account deficit.
    In the fall of 2013, Morocco capped some of its fuel subsidies in an
    effort to gradually reduce the country’s large budgetary deficit. Key
    economic challenges for Morocco include fighting corruption and
    reforming the education system, the judiciary, and the government's
    costly subsidy program.

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    claims and administers Western Sahara whose sovereignty remains
    unresolved; Morocco protests Spain's control over the coastal enclaves
    of Ceuta, Melilla, and Penon de Velez de la Gomera, the islands of
    Penon de Alhucemas and Islas Chafarinas, and surrounding waters; both
    countries claim Isla Perejil (Leila Island); discussions have not
    progressed on a comprehensive maritime delimitation, setting limits on
    resource exploration and refugee interdiction, since Morocco's 2002
    rejection of Spain's unilateral designation of a median line from the
    Canary Islands; Morocco serves as one of the primary launching areas of
    illegal migration into Spain from North Africa; Algeria's border with
    Morocco remains an irritant to bilateral relations, each nation
    accusing the other of harboring militants and arms smuggling; the
    National Liberation Front's assertions of a claim to Chirac Pastures in
    southeastern Morocco is a dormant dispute

  Trafficking in persons:
    current situation: Morocco is a source, destination, and transit
    country for men, women, and children who are subjected to forced labor
    and sex trafficking; Moroccan adults and children are exploited for
    forced labor and forced prostitution in the Middle East and Europe;
    some Moroccan girls recruited to work as maids experience conditions of
    forced labor, while some Moroccan boys are forced to work as
    apprentices in the artisan and construction industries and in mechanic
    shops; women and children from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia who
    voluntarily enter Morocco are subsequently coerced into prostitution
    or, less frequently, domestic service; women and children from Cote
    d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Nigeria are also
    vulnerable to sex trafficking and, to a lesser extent, forced labor in
    Morocco
    tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Morocco does not comply with the
    minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is
    making significant efforts to do so; the government does not
    demonstrate progress in investigating, prosecuting, convicting, and
    adequately punishing trafficking offenders and has failed to provide
    law enforcement data; it has not developed or employed systematic
    procedures to proactively identify trafficking victims among vulnerable
    groups, particularly the sub-Saharan migrant community, but has made
    some efforts to offer protective services to Moroccan women and child
    trafficking victims; Morocco continues to lack a single comprehensive
    anti-trafficking law (2013)

  Illicit drugs:
    one of the world's largest producers of illicit hashish; shipments of
    hashish mostly directed to Western Europe; transit point for cocaine
    from South America destined for Western Europe; significant consumer of
    cannabis
