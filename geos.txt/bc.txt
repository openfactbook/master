Botswana
========


Introduction

  Background:
    Formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, Botswana adopted its
    new name upon independence in 1966. More than four decades of
    uninterrupted civilian leadership, progressive social policies, and
    significant capital investment have created one of the most stable
    economies in Africa. Mineral extraction, principally diamond mining,
    dominates economic activity, though tourism is a growing sector due to
    the country's conservation practices and extensive nature preserves.
    Botswana has one of the world's highest known rates of HIV/AIDS
    infection, but also one of Africa's most progressive and comprehensive
    programs for dealing with the disease.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Botswana has maintained one of the world's highest economic growth
    rates since independence in 1966. However, economic growth was negative
    in 2009, with the industrial sector shrinking by 30%, after the global
    crisis reduced demand for Botswana's diamonds. Although the economy
    recovered in 2010, GDP growth has again slowed. Through fiscal
    discipline and sound management, Botswana transformed itself from one
    of the poorest countries in the world to a middle-income country with a
    per capita GDP of $16,400 in 2013. Two major investment services rank
    Botswana as the best credit risk in Africa. Diamond mining has fueled
    much of the expansion and currently accounts for more than one-third of
    GDP, 70-80% of export earnings, and about one-third of the government's
    revenues. Botswana's heavy reliance on a single luxury export was a
    critical factor in the sharp economic contraction of 2009. Tourism,
    financial services, subsistence farming, and cattle raising are other
    key sectors. According to official government statistics, unemployment
    reached 17.8% in 2009, but unofficial estimates run much higher. The
    prevalence of HIV/AIDS is second highest in the world and threatens
    Botswana's impressive economic gains. An expected leveling off in
    diamond production within the next two decades overshadows long-term
    prospects. A major international diamond company signed a 10-year deal
    with Botswana in 2012 to move its rough stone sorting and trading
    division from London to Gaborone by the end of 2013. The move may
    support Botswana's downstream diamond industry.
