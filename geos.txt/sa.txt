Saudi Arabia
============


Introduction

  Background:
    Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of Islam and home to Islam's two holiest
    shrines in Mecca and Medina. The king's official title is the Custodian
    of the Two Holy Mosques. The modern Saudi state was founded in 1932 by
    ABD AL-AZIZ bin Abd al-Rahman Al SAUD (Ibn Saud) after a 30-year
    campaign to unify most of the Arabian Peninsula. One of his male
    descendants rules the country today, as required by the country's 1992
    Basic Law. King ABDALLAH bin Abd al-Aziz ascended to the throne in
    2005. Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Saudi Arabia
    accepted the Kuwaiti royal family and 400,000 refugees while allowing
    Western and Arab troops to deploy on its soil for the liberation of
    Kuwait the following year. The continuing presence of foreign troops on
    Saudi soil after the liberation of Kuwait became a source of tension
    between the royal family and the public until all operational US troops
    left the country in 2003. Major terrorist attacks in May and November
    2003 spurred a strong on-going campaign against domestic terrorism and
    extremism. King ABDALLAH since 2005 has worked to incrementally
    modernize the Kingdom - driven by personal ideology and political
    pragmatism - through a series of social and economic initiatives,
    including expanding employment and social opportunities for women,
    attracting foreign investment, increasing the role of the private
    sector in the economy, and discouraging businesses from hiring foreign
    workers. The Arab Spring inspired protests - increasing in number since
    2011 but usually small in size - over primarily domestic issues among
    Saudi Arabia's majority Sunni population. Riyadh has taken a cautious
    but firm approach by arresting some protesters but releasing most of
    them quickly, and by using its state-sponsored clerics to counter
    political and Islamist activism. In addition, Saudi Arabia has seen
    protests among the Shia populace in the Eastern Province, who have
    protested primarily against the detention of political prisoners,
    endemic discrimination, and Bahraini and Saudi Government actions in
    Bahrain. Protests are met by a strong police presence, with some
    arrests, but not the level of bloodshed seen in protests elsewhere in
    the region. In response to the unrest, King ABDALLAH in February and
    March 2011 announced a series of benefits to Saudi citizens including
    funds to build affordable housing, salary increases for government
    workers, and unemployment entitlements. To promote increased political
    participation, the government held elections nationwide in September
    2011 for half the members of 285 municipal councils - a body that holds
    little influence in the Saudi Government. Also in September, the king
    announced that women will be allowed to run for and vote in future
    municipal elections - first held in 2005 - and serve as full members of
    the advisory Consultative Council. The country remains a leading
    producer of oil and natural gas and holds about 17% of the world's
    proven oil reserves. The government continues to pursue economic reform
    and diversification, particularly since Saudi Arabia's accession to the
    WTO in 2005, and promotes foreign investment in the kingdom. A
    burgeoning population, aquifer depletion, and an economy largely
    dependent on petroleum output and prices are ongoing governmental
    concerns.

    volcanism: despite many volcanic formations, there has been little
    activity in the past few centuries; volcanoes include Harrat Rahat,
    Harrat Khaybar, Harrat Lunayyir, and Jabal Yar

  Environment - current issues:
    desertification; depletion of underground water resources; the lack of
    perennial rivers or permanent water bodies has prompted the development
    of extensive seawater desalination facilities; coastal pollution from
    oil spills

  Geography - note:
    Saudi Arabia is the largest country in the world without a river;
    extensive coastlines on the Persian Gulf and Red Sea provide great
    leverage on shipping (especially crude oil) through the Persian Gulf
    and Suez Canal

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Saudi Arabia has an oil-based economy with strong government controls
    over major economic activities. It possesses about 16% of the world's
    proven petroleum reserves, ranks as the largest exporter of petroleum,
    and plays a leading role in OPEC. The petroleum sector accounts for
    roughly 80% of budget revenues, 45% of GDP, and 90% of export earnings.
    Saudi Arabia is encouraging the growth of the private sector in order
    to diversify its economy and to employ more Saudi nationals.
    Diversification efforts are focusing on power generation,
    telecommunications, natural gas exploration, and petrochemical sectors.
    Over 6 million foreign workers play an important role in the Saudi
    economy, particularly in the oil and service sectors, while Riyadh is
    struggling to reduce unemployment among its own nationals. Saudi
    officials are particularly focused on employing its large youth
    population, which generally lacks the education and technical skills
    the private sector needs. Riyadh has substantially boosted spending on
    job training and education, most recently with the opening of the King
    Abdallah University of Science and Technology - Saudi Arabia's first
    co-educational university. As part of its effort to attract foreign
    investment, Saudi Arabia acceded to the WTO in 2005. The government has
    begun establishing six "economic cities" in different regions of the
    country to promote foreign investment and plans to spend $373 billion
    between 2010 and 2014 on social development and infrastructure projects
    to advance Saudi Arabia's economic development.

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    Saudi Arabia has reinforced its concrete-filled security barrier along
    sections of the now fully demarcated border with Yemen to stem illegal
    cross-border activities; Kuwait and Saudi Arabia continue discussions
    on a maritime boundary with Iran; Saudi Arabia claims
    Egyptian-administered islands of Tiran and Sanafir

  Refugees and internally displaced persons:
    stateless persons: 70,000 (2012); note - thousands of biduns (stateless
    Arabs) are descendants of nomadic tribes who were not officially
    registered when national borders were established, while others
    migrated to Saudi Arabia in search of jobs; some have temporary
    identification cards that must be renewed every five years, but their
    rights remain restricted; most Palestinians have only legal resident
    status; some naturalized Yemenis were made stateless after being
    stripped of their passports when Yemen backed Iraq in its invasion of
    Kuwait in 1990; Saudi women cannot pass their citizenship on to their
    children, so if they marry a non-national, their children risk
    statelessness

  Trafficking in persons:
    current situation: Saudi Arabia is a destination country for men and
    women subjected to forced labor and, to a lesser extent, forced
    prostitution; men and women from Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal,
    Pakistan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, and many
    other countries voluntarily travel to Saudi Arabia as domestic servants
    or other low-skilled laborers, but some subsequently face conditions
    indicative of involuntary servitude (many are forced to work months or
    years beyond their contract term because employers withhold passports
    and required exit visas); women, primarily from Asian and African
    countries, are believed to be forced into prostitution in Saudi Arabia;
    others were reportedly kidnapped and forced into prostitution after
    running away from abusive employers; Yemeni, Nigerian, Pakistani,
    Afghan, Chadian, and Sudanese children were subjected to forced labor
    as beggars and street vendors in Saudi Arabia, facilitated by criminal
    gangs
    tier rating: Tier 3 - Saudi Arabia does not fully comply with the
    minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making
    significant efforts to do so; fewer victims were identified and
    referred to protection services than in the previous reporting period;
    the sponsorship system, including the exit visa requirement, continues
    to restrict the freedom of movement of migrant workers and hamper the
    ability of victims to pursue legal cases against their employers;
    however, the government has implemented regulations mandating the
    formation of unified recruitment companies to replace the sponsorship
    model; no specialized shelter was available to victims of sex
    trafficking or male victims of trafficking (2013)

  Illicit drugs:
    death penalty for traffickers; improving anti-money-laundering
    legislation and enforcement
