Liechtenstein
=============


Introduction

  Background:
    The Principality of Liechtenstein was established within the Holy Roman
    Empire in 1719. Occupied by both French and Russian troops during the
    Napoleonic Wars, it became a sovereign state in 1806 and joined the
    Germanic Confederation in 1815. Liechtenstein became fully independent
    in 1866 when the Confederation dissolved. Until the end of World War I,
    it was closely tied to Austria, but the economic devastation caused by
    that conflict forced Liechtenstein to enter into a customs and monetary
    union with Switzerland. Since World War II (in which Liechtenstein
    remained neutral), the country's low taxes have spurred outstanding
    economic growth. In 2000, shortcomings in banking regulatory oversight
    resulted in concerns about the use of financial institutions for money
    laundering. However, Liechtenstein implemented anti-money laundering
    legislation and a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the US that went
    into effect in 2003.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Despite its small size and limited natural resources, Liechtenstein has
    developed into a prosperous, highly industrialized, free-enterprise
    economy with a vital financial service sector and likely the second
    highest per capita income in the world. The Liechtenstein economy is
    widely diversified with a large number of small businesses. Low
    business taxes - the maximum tax rate is 20% - and easy incorporation
    rules have induced many holding companies to establish nominal offices
    in Liechtenstein providing 30% of state revenues. The country
    participates in a customs union with Switzerland and uses the Swiss
    franc as its national currency. It imports more than 90% of its energy
    requirements. Liechtenstein has been a member of the European Economic
    Area (an organization serving as a bridge between the European Free
    Trade Association (EFTA) and the EU) since May 1995. The government is
    working to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated
    Europe. Since 2008, Liechtenstein has faced renewed international
    pressure - particularly from Germany - to improve transparency in its
    banking and tax systems. In December 2008, Liechtenstein signed a Tax
    Information Exchange Agreement with the US. Upon Liechtenstein's
    conclusion of 12 bilateral information-sharing agreements, the OECD in
    October 2009 removed the principality from its "grey list" of countries
    that had yet to implement the organization's Model Tax Convention. By
    the end of 2010, Liechtenstein had signed 25 Tax Information Exchange
    Agreements or Double Tax Agreements. In 2011 Liechtenstein joined the
    Schengen area, which allows passport-free travel across 26 European
    countries.
