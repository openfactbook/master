Italy
=====


Introduction

  Background:
    Italy became a nation-state in 1861 when the regional states of the
    peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, were united under King
    Victor EMMANUEL II. An era of parliamentary government came to a close
    in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a Fascist
    dictatorship. His alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's defeat in
    World War II. A democratic republic replaced the monarchy in 1946 and
    economic revival followed. Italy is a charter member of NATO and the
    European Economic Community (EEC). It has been at the forefront of
    European economic and political unification, joining the Economic and
    Monetary Union in 1999. Persistent problems include sluggish economic
    growth, high youth and female unemployment, organized crime,
    corruption, and economic disparities between southern Italy and the
    more prosperous north.

    residents in the Bay of Naples area, have both been deemed Decade
    Volcanoes by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry
    of the Earth's Interior, worthy of study due to their explosive history
    and close proximity to human populations; Stromboli, on its namesake

    activity; other historically active volcanoes include Campi Flegrei,
    Ischia, Larderello, Pantelleria, Vulcano, and Vulsini

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Italy has a diversified industrial economy, which is divided into a
    developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a
    less-developed, highly subsidized, agricultural south, where
    unemployment is higher. The Italian economy is driven in large part by
    the manufacture of high-quality consumer goods produced by small and
    medium-sized enterprises, many of them family-owned. Italy also has a
    sizable underground economy, which by some estimates accounts for as
    much as 17% of GDP. These activities are most common within the
    agriculture, construction, and service sectors. Italy is the
    third-largest economy in the euro-zone, but its exceptionally high
    public debt and structural impediments to growth have rendered it
    vulnerable to scrutiny by financial markets. Public debt has increased
    steadily since 2007, topping 133% of GDP in 2013, but investor concerns
    about Italy and the broader euro-zone crisis eased in 2013, bringing
    down Italy's borrowing costs on sovereign government debt from euro-era
    records. The government still faces pressure from investors and
    European partners to sustain its efforts to address Italy's
    long-standing structural impediments to growth, such as labor market
    inefficiencies and widespread tax evasion. In 2013 economic growth and
    labor market conditions deteriorated, with growth at -1.8% and
    unemployment rising to 12.4%, with youth unemployment around 40%.
    Italy's GDP is now 8% below its 2007 pre-crisis level.
