Puerto Rico
===========

(territory of the US with commonwealth status)


Introduction

  Background:
    Populated for centuries by aboriginal peoples, the island was claimed
    by the Spanish Crown in 1493 following Christopher COLUMBUS' second
    voyage to the Americas. In 1898, after 400 years of colonial rule that
    saw the indigenous population nearly exterminated and African slave
    labor introduced, Puerto Rico was ceded to the US as a result of the
    Spanish-American War. Puerto Ricans were granted US citizenship in
    1917. Popularly-elected governors have served since 1948. In 1952, a
    constitution was enacted providing for internal self government. In
    plebiscites held in 1967, 1993, and 1998, voters chose not to alter the
    existing political status with the US, but the results of a 2012 vote
    left open the possibility of American statehood.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies in the Caribbean
    region, however, growth has been negative for the past four years, and
    unemployment rose to nearly 16% in 2011. The industrial sector has
    surpassed agriculture as the primary locus of economic activity and
    income. Mainland US firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico since
    the 1950s. US minimum wage laws apply. Sugar production has lost out to
    dairy production and other livestock products as the main source of
    income in the agricultural sector. Tourism has traditionally been an
    important source of income with estimated arrivals of more than 3.6
    million tourists in 2008. Closing the budget deficit while restoring
    economic growth and employment remain the central concerns of the
    government.
