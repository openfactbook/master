Cabo Verde
==========


Introduction

  Background:
    The uninhabited islands were discovered and colonized by the Portuguese
    in the 15th century; Cabo Verde subsequently became a trading center
    for African slaves and later an important coaling and resupply stop for
    whaling and transatlantic shipping. Following independence in 1975, and
    a tentative interest in unification with Guinea-Bissau, a one-party
    system was established and maintained until multi-party elections were
    held in 1990. Cabo Verde continues to exhibit one of Africa's most
    stable democratic governments. Repeated droughts during the second half
    of the 20th century caused significant hardship and prompted heavy
    emigration. As a result, Cabo Verde's expatriate population is greater
    than its domestic one. Most Cabo Verdeans have both African and
    Portuguese antecedents.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    The economy is service-oriented with commerce, transport, tourism, and
    public services accounting for about three-fourths of GDP. Tourism is
    the mainstay of the economy and it is heavily dependent on conditions
    in the euro zone countries. This island economy suffers from a poor
    natural resource base, including serious water shortages exacerbated by
    cycles of long-term drought and poor soil for agriculture on several of
    the islands. Although about 40% of the population lives in rural areas,
    the share of food production in GDP is low. About 82% of food must be
    imported. The fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully
    exploited. Cabo Verde annually runs a high trade deficit financed by
    foreign aid and remittances from its large pool of emigrants;
    remittances supplement GDP by more than 20%. Despite the lack of
    resources, sound economic management has produced steadily improving
    incomes. Continued economic reforms are aimed at developing the private
    sector and attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy and
    mitigate high unemployment. Future prospects depend heavily on the
    maintenance of aid flows, the encouragement of tourism, remittances,
    and the momentum of the government's development program. Cabo Verde
    became a member of the WTO in July 2008.
