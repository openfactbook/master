Yemen
=====


Introduction

  Background:
    North Yemen became independent of the Ottoman Empire in 1918. The
    British, who had set up a protectorate area around the southern port of
    Aden in the 19th century, withdrew in 1967 from what became South
    Yemen. Three years later, the southern government adopted a Marxist
    orientation. The massive exodus of hundreds of thousands of Yemenis
    from the south to the north contributed to two decades of hostility
    between the states. The two countries were formally unified as the
    Republic of Yemen in 1990. A southern secessionist movement and brief
    civil war in 1994 was quickly subdued. In 2000, Saudi Arabia and Yemen
    agreed to a delimitation of their border. Fighting in the northwest
    between the government and the Huthis, a Zaydi Shia minority, began in
    2004 and has since resulted in six rounds of fighting - the last ended
    in early 2010 with a cease-fire that continues to hold. The southern
    secessionist movement was revitalized in 2008 when a popular
    socioeconomic protest movement initiated the prior year took on
    political goals including secession. Public rallies in Sana'a against
    then President SALIH - inspired by similar demonstrations in Tunisia
    and Egypt - slowly built momentum starting in late January 2011 fueled
    by complaints over high unemployment, poor economic conditions, and
    corruption. By the following month, some protests had resulted in
    violence, and the demonstrations had spread to other major cities. By
    March the opposition had hardened its demands and was unifying behind
    calls for SALIH's immediate ouster, and prominent military and tribal
    leaders began defecting from SALIH's camp. The Gulf Cooperation Council
    (GCC) in late April 2011, in an attempt to mediate the crisis in Yemen,
    proposed an agreement in which the president would step down in
    exchange for immunity from prosecution. SALIH's refusal to sign an
    agreement led to heavy street fighting and his injury in an explosion
    in June 2011. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 2014 in October
    2011 calling on both sides to end the violence and complete a power
    transfer deal. In late November 2011, SALIH signed the GCC-brokered
    agreement to step down and to transfer some of his powers to Vice
    President Abd Rabuh Mansur HADI. Following elections in February 2012,
    won by HADI, SALIH formally transferred his powers. In accordance with
    the GCC initiative, Yemen launched a National Dialogue in March 2013 to
    discuss key constitutional, political, and social issues. HADI
    concluded the National Dialogue in January 2014. Subsequent steps in
    the transition process include constitutional drafting, a
    constitutional referendum, and national elections.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil
    resources for revenue. Petroleum accounts for roughly 25% of GDP and
    63% of government revenue. Yemen has tried to counter the effects of
    its declining oil resources and continuing attacks on its oil pipelines
    by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program
    initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the
    economy and foreign investment. In October 2009, Yemen exported its
    first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort. In
    January 2010, the international community established the Friends of
    Yemen group that aims to support Yemen's efforts toward economic and
    political reform. In 2012, the Friends of Yemen pledged nearly $7
    billion in assistance to Yemen. The Yemeni Government also endorsed a
    Mutual Accountability Framework to facilitate the efficient
    implementation of donor aid. The unrest that began in early 2011 caused
    GDP to plunge almost 11% in 2011. Availability of basic services,
    including electricity, water, and fuel, has improved since the
    transition, but progress toward achieving more sustainable economic
    stability has been slow and uneven. Yemen continues to face difficult
    long-term challenges, including declining water resources, high
    unemployment, severe food scarcity, and a high population growth rate.

Communications

  Telephones - main lines in use:
    1.1 million (2012)

  Telephones - mobile cellular:
    13.9 million (2012)

  Telephone system:
    general assessment: since unification in 1990, efforts have been made
    to create a national telecommunications network
    domestic: the national network consists of microwave radio relay,
    cable, tropospheric scatter, GSM and CDMA mobile-cellular telephone
    systems; fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity remains low by
    regional standards
    international: country code - 967; landing point for the international
    submarine cable Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe (FLAG); satellite
    earth stations - 3 Intelsat (2 Indian Ocean and 1 Atlantic Ocean), 1
    Intersputnik (Atlantic Ocean region), and 2 Arabsat; microwave radio
    relay to Saudi Arabia and Djibouti (2006)

  Broadcast media:
    state-run TV with 2 stations; state-run radio with 2 national radio
    stations and 5 local stations; stations from Oman and Saudi Arabia can
    be accessed (2007)

  Internet country code:
    .ye

  Internet hosts:
    33,206 (2012)

  Ports and terminals:
    major seaport(s): Aden, Al Hudaydah, Al Mukalla

  Transportation - note:
    the International Maritime Bureau reports offshore waters in the Gulf
    of Aden are high risk for piracy; numerous vessels, including
    commercial shipping and pleasure craft, have been attacked and hijacked
    both at anchor and while underway; crew, passengers, and cargo are held
    for ransom; the presence of several naval task forces in the Gulf of
    Aden and additional anti-piracy measures on the part of ship operators
    reduced the incidence of piracy in that body of water by more than half
    in 2010

Transnational Issues

    cross-border activities

  Refugees and internally displaced persons:
    refugees (country of origin): 5,740 (Ethiopia) (2013); 233,723
    (Somalia) (2014)
    IDPs: 309,823 (conflict in Sa'ada governorate; clashes between AQAP and
    government forces) (2014)

  Trafficking in persons:
    current situation: Yemen is a source and, to a much lesser extent,
    transit and destination country for men, women, and children subjected
    to forced labor and sex trafficking; some Yemeni children, mostly boys,
    migrate to Yemeni cities or across the border to Saudi Arabia and, less
    frequently Oman, where they end up as forced laborers in domestic
    service or small shops, beggars, or prostitutes; some of the large
    number of child workers in Yemen also face conditions of forced labor;
    other Yemeni children are conscripted into the government's armed
    forces or tribal or rebel militias; to a lesser degree, Yemen is a
    country of origin for girls trafficked within country or to Saudi
    Arabia to work as prostitutes in hotels and clubs; additionally, Yemen
    is a destination and transit country for women and children from the
    Horn of Africa who are looking for work or have received false job
    offers in the Gulf states but are subjected to sexual exploitation or
    forced labor upon arrival; reports indicate that adults and children
    are still sold or inherited as slaves in Yemen
