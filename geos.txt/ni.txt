Nigeria

Introduction

  Background:
    British influence and control over what would become Nigeria and
    Africa's most populous country grew through the 19th century. A series
    of constitutions after World War II granted Nigeria greater autonomy;
    independence came in 1960. Following nearly 16 years of military rule,
    a new constitution was adopted in 1999, and a peaceful transition to
    civilian government was completed. The government continues to face the
    daunting task of reforming a petroleum-based economy, whose revenues
    have been squandered through corruption and mismanagement, and
    institutionalizing democracy. In addition, Nigeria continues to
    experience longstanding ethnic and religious tensions. Although both
    the 2003 and 2007 presidential elections were marred by significant
    irregularities and violence, Nigeria is currently experiencing its
    longest period of civilian rule since independence. The general
    elections of April 2007 marked the first civilian-to-civilian transfer
    of power in the country's history and the elections of 2011 were
    generally regarded as credible. In January 2014, Nigeria assumed a
    nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2014-15 term.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Following an April 2014 statistical "rebasing" exercise, Nigeria has
    emerged as Africa's largest economy, with 2013 GDP estimated at US$ 502
    billion. Oil has been a dominant source of government revenues since
    the 1970s. Regulatory constraints and security risks have limited new
    investment in oil and natural gas, and Nigeria's oil production
    contracted in 2012 and 2013. Nevertheless, the Nigerian economy has
    continued to grow at a rapid 6-8% per annum (pre-rebasing), driven by
    growth in agriculture, telecommunications, and services, and the
    medium-term outlook for Nigeria is good, assuming oil output stabilizes
    and oil prices remain strong. Fiscal authorities pursued
    countercyclical policies in 2011-2013, significantly reducing the
    budget deficit. Monetary policy has also been responsive and effective.
    Following the 2008-9 global financial crises, the banking sector was
    effectively recapitalized and regulation enhanced. Despite its strong
    fundamentals, oil-rich Nigeria has been hobbled by inadequate power
    supply, lack of infrastructure, delays in the passage of legislative
    reforms, an inefficient property registration system, restrictive trade
    policies, an inconsistent regulatory environment, a slow and
    ineffective judicial system, unreliable dispute resolution mechanisms,
    insecurity, and pervasive corruption. Economic diversification and
    strong growth have not translated into a significant decline in poverty
    levels - over 62% of Nigeria's 170 million people live in extreme
    poverty. President JONATHAN has established an economic team that
    includes experienced and reputable members and has announced plans to
    increase transparency, continue to diversify production, and further
    improve fiscal management. The government is working to develop
    stronger public-private partnerships for roads, agriculture, and power.

Communications

  Telephones - main lines in use:
    418,200 (2012)

  Telephones - mobile cellular:
    112.78 million (2012)

  Telephone system:
    general assessment: further expansion and modernization of the
    fixed-line telephone network is needed; network quality remains a
    problem
    domestic: the addition of a second fixed-line provider in 2002 resulted
    in faster growth but subscribership remains only about 1 per 100
    persons; mobile-cellular services growing rapidly, in part responding
    to the shortcomings of the fixed-line network; multiple cellular
    providers operate nationally with subscribership base approaching 60
    per 100 persons
    international: country code - 234; landing point for the SAT-3/WASC
    fiber-optic submarine cable that provides connectivity to Europe and
    Asia; satellite earth stations - 3 Intelsat (2 Atlantic Ocean and 1
    Indian Ocean) (2010)

  Broadcast media:
    nearly 70 federal government-controlled national and regional TV
    stations; all 36 states operate TV stations; several private TV
    stations operational; cable and satellite TV subscription services are
    available; network of federal government-controlled national, regional,
    and state radio stations; roughly 40 state government-owned radio
    stations typically carry their own programs except for news broadcasts;
    about 20 private radio stations; transmissions of international
    broadcasters are available (2007)

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    Joint Border Commission with Cameroon reviewed 2002 ICJ ruling on the
    entire boundary and bilaterally resolved differences, including June
    2006 Greentree Agreement that immediately cedes sovereignty of the
    Bakassi Peninsula to Cameroon with a phase-out of Nigerian control
    within two years while resolving patriation issues; the ICJ ruled on an
    equidistance settlement of Cameroon-Equatorial Guinea-Nigeria maritime
    boundary in the Gulf of Guinea, but imprecisely defined coordinates in
    the ICJ decision and a sovereignty dispute between Equatorial Guinea
    and Cameroon over an island at the mouth of the Ntem River all
    contribute to the delay in implementation; only Nigeria and Cameroon
    have heeded the Lake Chad Commission's admonition to ratify the
    delimitation treaty which also includes the Chad-Niger and
    Niger-Nigeria boundaries; location of Benin-Niger-Nigeria tripoint is
    unresolved

  Refugees and internally displaced persons:
    IDPs: 3.3 million (Boko Haram attacks and counterinsurgency efforts in
    northern Nigeria; communal violence between Christians and Muslims in
    the middle belt region, political violence; flooding; forced evictions;
    cattle rustling; competition for resources; displacement is mostly
    short-term) (2014)

    Nigeria has improved some anti-money-laundering controls, resulting in
    its removal from the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF's)
    Noncooperative Countries and Territories List in June 2006; Nigeria's
    anti-money-laundering regime continues to be monitored by FATF
