Clipperton Island

(possession of France)


Introduction

  Background:
    This isolated atoll was named for John CLIPPERTON, a pirate who was
    rumored to have made it his hideout early in the 18th century. Annexed
    by France in 1855 and claimed by the United States, it was seized by
    Mexico in 1897. Arbitration eventually awarded the island to France in
    1931, which took possession in 1935.
