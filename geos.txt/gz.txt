Gaza Strip
==========


Introduction

  Background:
    Inhabited since at least the 15th century B.C., Gaza has been dominated
    by many different peoples and empires throughout its history; it was
    incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in the early 16th century. Gaza
    fell to British forces during World War I, becoming a part of the
    British Mandate of Palestine. Following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War,
    Egypt administered the newly formed Gaza Strip; it was captured by
    Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967. Under a series of agreements signed
    between 1994 and 1999, Israel transferred to the Palestinian Authority
    (PA) security and civilian responsibility for many
    Palestinian-populated areas of the Gaza Strip as well as the West Bank.
    Negotiations to determine the permanent status of the West Bank and
    Gaza Strip stalled after the outbreak of an intifada in mid- 2000. In
    early 2003, the "Quartet" of the US, EU, UN, and Russia, presented a
    roadmap to a final peace settlement by 2005, calling for two states -
    Israel and a democratic Palestine. Following Palestinian leader Yasir
    ARAFAT's death in late 2004 and the subsequent election of Mahmud ABBAS
    (head of the Fatah political party) as the PA president, Israel and the
    PA agreed to move the peace process forward. Israel in late 2005
    unilaterally withdrew all of its settlers and soldiers and dismantled
    its military facilities in the Gaza Strip, but continues to control
    maritime, airspace, and other access. In early 2006, the Islamic
    Resistance Movement, HAMAS, won the Palestinian Legislative Council
    election and took control of the PA government. Attempts to form a
    unity government between Fatah and HAMAS failed, and violent clashes
    between Fatah and HAMAS supporters ensued, culminating in HAMAS's
    violent seizure of all military and governmental institutions in the
    Gaza Strip in June 2007. Fatah and HAMAS in early 2011 agreed to
    reunify the Gaza Strip and West Bank, but the factions have struggled
    to implement details on governance and security. Brief periods of
    increased violence between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Gaza
    Strip in 2007-08 and again in 2012, both led to Egyptian-brokered
    truces. The status quo remains with HAMAS in control of the Gaza Strip
    and the PA governing the West Bank.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Israeli security controls imposed since the end of the second intifada
    have degraded economic conditions in the Gaza Strip, the smaller of the
    two areas comprising the Palestinian territories. Israeli-imposed
    border closures, which became more restrictive after HAMAS seized
    control of the territory in June 2007, have resulted in high
    unemployment, elevated poverty rates, and a sharp contraction of the
    private sector that had relied primarily on export markets. Gazans
    increasingly turned to tunnels that ran under the Egyptian border to
    bring in fuel, construction materials, and consumer goods. In July
    2013, Egyptian authorities began a serious crackdown on the tunnels,
    causing shortages in Gaza. The population depends on government
    spending - by both the Palestinian Authority and HAMAS's de facto
    government - and humanitarian assistance. Changes to Israeli
    restrictions on imports in 2010 resulted in a rebound in some economic
    activity, but regular exports from Gaza still are not permitted.
    Standard-of-living measures remain below levels seen in the mid-1990s.
