Bahamas, The
============


Introduction

  Background:
    Lucayan Indians inhabited the islands when Christopher COLUMBUS first
    set foot in the New World on San Salvador in 1492. British settlement
    of the islands began in 1647; the islands became a colony in 1783.
    Since attaining independence from the UK in 1973, The Bahamas has
    prospered through tourism, international banking, and investment
    management. Because of its location, the country is a major
    transshipment point for illegal drugs, particularly shipments to the US
    and Europe, and its territory is used for smuggling illegal migrants
    into the US.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    The Bahamas is one of the wealthiest Caribbean countries with an
    economy heavily dependent on tourism and offshore banking. Tourism
    together with tourism-driven construction and manufacturing accounts
    for approximately 60% of GDP and directly or indirectly employs half of
    the archipelago's labor force. Financial services constitute the
    second-most important sector of the Bahamian economy and, when combined
    with business services, account for about 35% of GDP. Manufacturing and
    agriculture combined contribute less than a 10th of GDP and show little
    growth, despite government incentives aimed at those sectors. The
    economy of The Bahamas shrank at an average pace of 0.8% annually
    between 2007-2011, and tourism, financial services, and construction -
    pillars of the national economy - remain subdued. Conditions are
    improving in the tourism sector, however, due to steady foreign
    investment led activity. New resort and marina developments are likely
    to provide sustained employment opportunities.
