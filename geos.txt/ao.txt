Introduction

  Background:
    Angola is still rebuilding its country since the end of a 27-year civil
    war in 2002. Fighting between the Popular Movement for the Liberation
    of Angola (MPLA), led by Jose Eduardo DOS SANTOS, and the National
    Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), led by Jonas
    SAVIMBI, followed independence from Portugal in 1975. Peace seemed
    imminent in 1992 when Angola held national elections, but fighting
    picked up again in 1993. Up to 1.5 million lives may have been lost -
    and 4 million people displaced - during the more than a quarter century
    of fighting. SAVIMBI's death in 2002 ended UNITA's insurgency and
    cemented the MPLA's hold on power. President DOS SANTOS pushed through
    a new constitution in 2010; elections held in 2012 saw him installed as
    president.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Angola's high growth rate in recent years was driven by high
    international prices for its oil. Angola became a member of OPEC in
    late 2006 and its current assigned a production quota of 1.65 million
    barrels a day (bbl/day). Oil production and its supporting activities
    contribute about 85% of GDP. Diamond exports contribute an additional
    5%. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for most of
    the people, but half of the country's food is still imported. Increased
    oil production supported growth averaging more than 17% per year from
    2004 to 2008. A postwar reconstruction boom and resettlement of
    displaced persons has led to high rates of growth in construction and
    agriculture as well. Much of the country's infrastructure is still
    damaged or undeveloped from the 27-year-long civil war. Land mines left
    from the war still mar the countryside, even though peace was
    established after the death of rebel leader Jonas SAVIMBI in February
    2002. Since 2005, the government has used billions of dollars in credit
    lines from China, Brazil, Portugal, Germany, Spain, and the EU to
    rebuild Angola's public infrastructure. The global recession that
    started in 2008 temporarily stalled economic growth. Lower prices for
    oil and diamonds during the global recession slowed GDP growth to 2.4%
    in 2009, and many construction projects stopped because Luanda accrued
    $9 billion in arrears to foreign construction companies when government
    revenue fell in 2008 and 2009. Angola abandoned its currency peg in
    2009, and in November 2009 signed onto an IMF Stand-By Arrangement loan
    of $1.4 billion to rebuild international reserves. Consumer inflation
    declined from 325% in 2000 to about 10% in 2012. Higher oil prices have
    helped Angola turn a budget deficit of 8.6% of GDP in 2009 into an
    surplus of 12% of GDP in 2012. Corruption, especially in the extractive
    sectors, also is a major challenge.

    telephone network; by 2010, the number of fixed-line providers had
    expanded to 5; Angola Telecom established mobile-cellular service in
    Luanda in 1993 and the network has been extended to larger towns; a
    privately owned, mobile-cellular service provider began operations in
    2001

    teledensity about 50 telephones per 100 persons in 2011

  Trafficking in persons:
    current situation: Angola is a source and destination country for men,
    women, and children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor in
    agriculture, construction, domestic service, and diamond mines; some
    Angolan girls are forced into domestic prostitution, while some Angolan
    boys are taken to Namibia as forced laborers or are forced to be
    cross-border couriers; women and children are also forced into domestic
    service in South Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Namibia,
    and European countries; Vietnamese, Brazilian, and Chinese women are
    trafficked to Angola for prostitution, while Chinese, Southeast Asian,
    Namibian, and possibly Congolese migrants are subjected to forced labor
    in Angola's construction industry
    tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Angola does not fully comply with the
    minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is
    making significant efforts to do so; authorities opened one internal
    labor trafficking investigation but have not initiated the prosecution
    of any trafficking offenders, has never convicted a trafficking
    offender, and does not have a law specifically prohibiting all forms of
    trafficking; the government has not adopted amendments to the penal
    code reflecting the 2010 constitutional provision prohibiting human
    trafficking and has not finalized draft anti-trafficking legislation;
    the government has made minimal efforts to protect trafficking victims
    but continues to lack a systematic process for identifying trafficking
    victims and providing legal remedies to victims (2013)
