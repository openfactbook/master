Introduction

  Background:
    Modern-day Laos has its roots in the ancient Lao kingdom of Lan Xang,
    established in the 14th century under King FA NGUM. For 300 years Lan
    Xang had influence reaching into present-day Cambodia and Thailand, as
    well as over all of what is now Laos. After centuries of gradual
    decline, Laos came under the domination of Siam (Thailand) from the
    late 18th century until the late 19th century when it became part of
    French Indochina. The Franco-Siamese Treaty of 1907 defined the current
    Lao border with Thailand. In 1975, the communist Pathet Lao took
    control of the government ending a six-century-old monarchy and
    instituting a strict socialist regime closely aligned to Vietnam. A
    gradual, limited return to private enterprise and the liberalization of
    foreign investment laws began in 1988. Laos became a member of ASEAN in
    1997 and the WTO in 2013.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    The government of Laos, one of the few remaining one-party communist
    states, began decentralizing control and encouraging private enterprise
    in 1986. The results, starting from an extremely low base, were
    striking - growth averaged 6% per year from 1988-2008 except during the
    short-lived drop caused by the Asian financial crisis that began in
    1997. Laos' growth exceeded 7% per year during 2008-13. Despite this
    high growth rate, Laos remains a country with an underdeveloped
    infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. It has a basic, but
    improving, road system, and limited external and internal land-line
    telecommunications. Electricity is available in 83 % of the country.
    Laos' economy is heavily dependent on capital-intensive natural
    resource exports. The labor force, however, still relies on
    agriculture, dominated by rice cultivation in lowland areas, which
    accounts for about 25% of GDP and 73% of total employment. Economic
    growth has reduced official poverty rates from 46% in 1992 to 26% in
    2010. The economy also has benefited from high-profile foreign direct
    investment in hydropower, copper and gold mining, logging, and
    construction though some projects in these industries have drawn
    criticism for their environmental impacts. Laos gained Normal Trade
    Relations status with the US in 2004 and applied for Generalized System
    of Preferences trade benefits in 2013 after being admitted to the World
    Trade Organization earlier in the year. Laos is in the process of
    implementing a value-added tax system. Simplified investment procedures
    and expanded bank credits for small farmers and small entrepreneurs
    will improve Laos' economic prospects. The government appears committed
    to raising the country's profile among investors, but suffered through
    a fiscal crisis in 2013 brought about by public sector wage increases,
    fiscal mismanagement, and revenue shortfalls. The World Bank has
    declared that Laos' goal of graduating from the UN Development
    Program's list of least-developed countries by 2020 is achievable, and
    the country is preparing to enter the ASEAN Economic Community in 2015.

  Military - note:
    serving one of the world's least developed countries, the Lao People's
    Armed Forces (LPAF) is small, poorly funded, and ineffectively
    resourced; its mission focus is border and internal security, primarily
    in countering ethnic Hmong insurgent groups; together with the Lao
    People's Revolutionary Party and the government, the Lao People's Army
    (LPA) is the third pillar of state machinery, and as such is expected
    to suppress political and civil unrest and similar national
    emergencies, but the LPA also has upgraded skills to respond to avian
    influenza outbreaks; there is no perceived external threat to the state
    and the LPA maintains strong ties with the neighboring Vietnamese
    military (2008)
