Aruba
=====

(part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands)


Introduction

  Background:
    Discovered and claimed for Spain in 1499, Aruba was acquired by the
    Dutch in 1636. The island's economy has been dominated by three main
    industries. A 19th century gold rush was followed by prosperity brought
    on by the opening in 1924 of an oil refinery. The last decades of the
    20th century saw a boom in the tourism industry. Aruba seceded from the
    Netherlands Antilles in 1986 and became a separate, autonomous member
    of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Movement toward full independence
    was halted at Aruba's request in 1990.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Tourism and offshore banking are the mainstays of the small open Aruban
    economy. Tourist arrivals have rebounded strongly following a dip after
    the 11 September 2001 attacks. Tourism now accounts for over 80 % of
    economic activity. Over 1.5 million tourists per year visit Aruba, with
    75% of those from the US. The rapid growth of the tourism sector has
    resulted in a substantial expansion of other activities. Construction
    continues to boom with hotel capacity five times the 1985 level. Aruba
    is heavily dependent on imports and is making efforts to expand exports
    to achieve a more desirable trade balance. Aruba weathered two major
    shocks in recent years: fallout from the global financial crisis, which
    had its largest impact on tourism, and the closure of its oil refinery
    in 2009. Economic recovery is progressing gradually, but output is
    still 12% below its pre-crisis level. Aruba’s banking sector
    withstood the recession well, and unemployment has significantly
    decreased.
