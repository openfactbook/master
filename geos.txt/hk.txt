(special administrative region of China)


Introduction

  Background:
    Occupied by the UK in 1841, Hong Kong was formally ceded by China the
    following year; various adjacent lands were added later in the 19th
    century. Pursuant to an agreement signed by China and the UK on 19
    December 1984, Hong Kong became the Hong Kong Special Administrative
    Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China on 1 July 1997. In this
    agreement, China promised that, under its "one country, two systems"
    formula, China's socialist economic system would not be imposed on Hong
    Kong and that Hong Kong would enjoy a "high degree of autonomy" in all
    matters except foreign and defense affairs for the subsequent 50 years.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Hong Kong has a free market economy, highly dependent on international
    trade and finance - the value of goods and services trade, including
    the sizable share of re-exports, is about four times GDP. Hong Kong has
    no tariffs on imported goods, and it levies excise duties on only four
    commodities, whether imported or produced locally: hard alcohol,
    tobacco, hydrocarbon oil, and methyl alcohol. There are no quotas or
    dumping laws. Hong Kong's open economy left it exposed to the global
    economic slowdown that began in 2008. Although increasing integration
    with China, through trade, tourism, and financial links, helped it to
    make an initial recovery more quickly than many observers anticipated,
    its continued reliance on foreign trade and investment leaves it
    vulnerable to renewed global financial market volatility or a slowdown
    in the global economy. The Hong Kong government is promoting the
    Special Administrative Region (SAR) as the site for Chinese renminbi
    (RMB) internationalization. Hong Kong residents are allowed to
    establish RMB-denominated savings accounts; RMB-denominated corporate
    and Chinese government bonds have been issued in Hong Kong; and RMB
    trade settlement is allowed. The territory far exceeded the RMB
    conversion quota set by Beijing for trade settlements in 2010 due to
    the growth of earnings from exports to the mainland. RMB deposits grew
    to roughly 12% of total system deposits in Hong Kong by the end of
    2013. The government is pursuing efforts to introduce additional use of
    RMB in Hong Kong financial markets and is seeking to expand the RMB
    quota. The mainland has long been Hong Kong's largest trading partner,
    accounting for about half of Hong Kong's total trade by value. Hong
    Kong's natural resources are limited, and food and raw materials must
    be imported. As a result of China's easing of travel restrictions, the
    number of mainland tourists to the territory has surged from 4.5
    million in 2001 to 34.9 million in 2012, outnumbering visitors from all
    other countries combined. Hong Kong has also established itself as the
    premier stock market for Chinese firms seeking to list abroad. In 2012
    mainland Chinese companies constituted about 46.6% of the firms listed
    on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and accounted for about 57.4% of the
    Exchange's market capitalization. During the past decade, as Hong
    Kong's manufacturing industry moved to the mainland, its service
    industry has grown rapidly. Credit expansion and tight housing supply
    conditions have caused Hong Kong property prices to rise rapidly;
    consumer prices increased by more than 4% in 2013. Lower and middle
    income segments of the population are increasingly unable to afford
    adequate housing. Hong Kong continues to link its currency closely to
    the US dollar, maintaining an arrangement established in 1983. In 2013,
    Hong Kong and China signed new agreements under the Closer Economic
    Partnership Agreement, adopted in 2003 to forge closer ties between
    Hong Kong and the mainland. The new measures, effective from January
    2014, cover services and trade facilitation, and will improve access to
    the mainland's service sector for Hong Kong-based companies.
