World Summary
=============


Introduction

  Background:
    Globally, the 20th century was marked by: (a) two devastating world
    wars; (b) the Great Depression of the 1930s; (c) the end of vast
    colonial empires; (d) rapid advances in science and technology, from
    the first airplane flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina (US) to the
    landing on the moon; (e) the Cold War between the Western alliance and
    the Warsaw Pact nations; (f) a sharp rise in living standards in North
    America, Europe, and Japan; (g) increased concerns about environmental
    degradation including deforestation, energy and water shortages,
    declining biological diversity, and air pollution; (h) the onset of the
    AIDS epidemic; and (i) the ultimate emergence of the US as the only
    world superpower. The planet's population continues to explode: from 1
    billion in 1820 to 2 billion in 1930, 3 billion in 1960, 4 billion in
    1974, 5 billion in 1987, 6 billion in 1999, and 7 billion in 2012. For
    the 21st century, the continued exponential growth in science and
    technology raises both hopes (e.g., advances in medicine and
    agriculture) and fears (e.g., development of even more lethal weapons
    of war).


Geography

  Geographic overview:
    The surface of the earth is approximately 70.9% water and 29.1% land.
    The former portion is divided into large water bodies termed oceans.
    The World Factbook recognizes and describes five oceans, which are in
    decreasing order of size: the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian
    Ocean, Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean.
    The land portion is generally divided into several, large, discrete
    landmasses termed continents. Depending on the convention used, the
    number of continents can vary from five to seven. The most common
    classification recognizes seven, which are (from largest to smallest):
    Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and
    Australia. Asia and Europe are sometimes lumped together into a
    Eurasian continent resulting in six continents. Alternatively, North
    and South America are sometimes grouped as simply the Americas,
    resulting in a continent total of six (or five, if the Eurasia
    designation is used).
    North America is commonly understood to include the island of
    Greenland, the isles of the Caribbean, and to extend south all the way
    to the Isthmus of Panama. The easternmost extent of Europe is generally
    defined as being the Ural Mountains and the Ural River; on the
    southeast the Caspian Sea; and on the south the Caucasus Mountains, the
    Black Sea, and the Mediterranean. Portions of Azerbaijan, Georgia,
    Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkey fall within both Europe and Asia, but in
    every instance the larger section is in Asia. These countries are
    considered part of both continents. Armenia and Cyprus, which lie
    completely in Western Asia, are geopolitically European countries.
    Asia usually incorporates all the islands of the Philippines, Malaysia,
    and Indonesia. The islands of the Pacific are often lumped with
    Australia into a "land mass" termed Oceania or Australasia. Africa's
    northeast extremity is frequently delimited at the Isthmus of Suez, but
    for geopolitical purposes, the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula is often
    included as part of Africa.
    Although the above groupings are the most common, different continental
    dispositions are recognized or taught in certain parts of the world,
    with some arrangements more heavily based on cultural spheres rather
    than physical geographic considerations.

  Maritime claims:
    a variety of situations exist, but in general, most countries make the
    following claims measured from the mean low-tide baseline as described
    in the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea: territorial sea - 12
    nm, contiguous zone - 24 nm, and exclusive economic zone - 200 nm;
    additional zones provide for exploitation of continental shelf
    resources and an exclusive fishing zone; boundary situations with
    neighboring states prevent many countries from extending their fishing
    or economic zones to a full 200 nm

  Climate:
    a wide equatorial band of hot and humid tropical climates - bordered
    north and south by subtropical temperate zones - that separate two
    large areas of cold and dry polar climates

  Terrain:
    the greatest ocean depth is the Mariana Trench at 10,924 m in the
    Pacific Ocean

  Elevation extremes:
    lowest point: Bentley Subglacial Trench (Antarctica) -2,555 m
    note: in the oceanic realm, Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench is
    the lowest point, lying -10,924 m below the surface of the Pacific
    Ocean
    highest point: Mount Everest 8,850 m
    top ten highest mountains (measured from sea level): Mount Everest
    (China-Nepal) 8,850 m; K2 (Pakistan) 8,611 m; Kanchenjunga
    (India-Nepal) 8,598 m; Lhotse (Nepal) 8,516 m; Makalu (China-Nepal)
    8,463 m; Cho Oyu (China-Nepal) 8,201 m; Dhaulagiri (Nepal) 8,167 m;
    Manaslu (Nepal) 8,163 m; Nanga Parbat (Pakistan) 8,125 m; Anapurna
    (Nepal) 8,091 m

  Natural resources:
    the rapid depletion of nonrenewable mineral resources, the depletion of
    forest areas and wetlands, the extinction of animal and plant species,
    and the deterioration in air and water quality (especially in some
    countries of Eastern Europe, the former USSR, and China) pose serious
    long-term problems that governments and peoples are only beginning to
    address

  Land use:
    arable land: 10.43%
    permanent crops: 1.15%
    other: 88.42% (2011)

  Irrigated land:
    3,096,621.45 sq km (2011 est.)

  Total renewable water resources:
    53,789.29 cu km (2011)

  Natural hazards:
    large areas subject to severe weather (tropical cyclones); natural
    disasters (earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions)
    volcanism: volcanism is a fundamental driver and consequence of plate
    tectonics, the physical process reshaping the Earth's lithosphere; the
    world is home to more than 1,500 potentially active volcanoes, with
    over 500 of these having erupted in historical times; an estimated 500
    million people live near these volcanoes; associated dangers include
    lava flows, lahars (mudflows), pyroclastic flows, ash clouds, ash fall,
    ballistic projectiles, gas emissions, landslides, earthquakes, and
    tsunamis; in the 1990s, the International Association of Volcanology
    and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior, created a list of 16 Decade
    Volcanoes worthy of special study because of their great potential for
    destruction: Avachinsky-Koryaksky (Russia), Colima (Mexico), Etna
    (Italy), Galeras (Colombia), Mauna Loa (United States), Merapi
    (Indonesia), Nyiragongo (Democratic Republic of the Congo), Rainier
    (United States), Sakurajima (Japan), Santa Maria (Guatemala), Santorini
    (Greece), Taal (Philippines), Teide (Spain), Ulawun (Papua New Guinea),
    Unzen (Japan), Vesuvius (Italy)

  Environment - current issues:
    large areas subject to overpopulation, industrial disasters, pollution
    (air, water, acid rain, toxic substances), loss of vegetation
    (overgrazing, deforestation, desertification), loss of wildlife, soil
    degradation, soil depletion, erosion; global warming becoming a greater
    concern

  Geography - note:
    the world is now thought to be about 4.55 billion years old, just about
    one-third of the 13.8-billion-year age estimated for the universe

    world; aproximately 80% of these languages are spoken by less than
    100,000 people; about 50 languages are spoken by only 1 person;
    communities that are isolated from each other in mountainous regions
    often develop multiple languages; Papua New Guinea, for example, boasts
    about 836 separate languages

    121 (effective 1 July 2012) countries have accepted jurisdiction of the
    ICCt (see Appendix B for a clarification on the differing mandates of
    the ICJ and ICCt)


Economy

  Economy - overview:
    The international financial crisis of 2008-09 led to the first downturn
    in global output since 1946 and presented the world with a major new
    challenge: determining what mix of fiscal and monetary policies to
    follow to restore growth and jobs, while keeping inflation and debt
    under control. Financial stabilization and stimulus programs that
    started in 2009-11, combined with lower tax revenues in 2009-10,
    required most countries to run large budget deficits. Treasuries issued
    new public debt - totaling $9.1 trillion since 2008 - to pay for the
    additional expenditures. To keep interest rates low, most central banks
    monetized that debt, injecting large sums of money into their economies
    - between December 2008 and December 2013 the global money supply
    increased by more than 35%. Governments now are faced with the
    difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without
    saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice
    long-term growth and financial stability. And when economic activity
    picks up, central banks will confront the difficult task of containing
    inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further
    growth.
    
    Fiscal and monetary data for 2012 are currently available for 180
    countries, which together account for 98.5% of World GDP. Of the 180
    countries, 85 pursued unequivocally expansionary policies, boosting
    government spending while also expanding their money supply relatively
    rapidly - faster than the world average of 4.1%; 37 followed
    restrictive fiscal and monetary policies, reducing government spending
    and holding money growth to less than the 4.1% average; and the
    remaining 58 followed a mix of counterbalancing fiscal and monetary
    policies, either reducing government spending while accelerating money
    growth, or boosting spending while curtailing money growth.
    
    (For more information, see attached spreadsheet, Fiscal and Monetary
    Data, 2008-2012.)
    
    In 2012, fiscal policy shifted towards greater austerity for a majority
    of the countries. In an attempt to attack their deficit and debt
    problems head-on, nearly 5 out of 6 countries slowed the rate of growth
    of government spending, and 1 in 3 countries actually lowered the level
    of their expenditures. The global growth rate for government
    expenditures dropped from 5.9% in 2010 and 10.1% in 2011, to just 1.4%
    in 2012. Roughly 1 out of 3 central banks tightened monetary policy,
    decelerating the rate of growth of their money supply, and about 1 out
    of 7 actually withdrew money from circulation. Growth of the global
    money supply, as measured by the narrowly defined M1, slowed from 8.7%
    in 2009 and 10.4% in 2010 to 5.2% in 2011 and 4.1% in 2012.
    
    These policy choices significantly affected economic performance. The
    global budget deficit narrowed to roughly $2.7 trillion in 2012, or
    3.8% of World GDP. But growth of the world economy slipped from 5.1% in
    2010 and 3.7% in 2011, to just 3.1% in 2012, and 2.9% in 2013.
    
    Countries with expansionary fiscal and monetary policies achieved
    significantly higher rates of growth, lower unemployment, higher growth
    of tax revenues, and greater success reducing the public debt burden
    than those countries that chose contractionary policies. In 2012, the
    85 countries that followed a pro-growth approach achieved a median GDP
    growth rate of 4.9%, compared to just 0.8% for the 37 countries with
    restrictive fiscal and monetary policies, a difference of more than 4
    percentage points. Among the 85, China grew 7.8%, Indonesia 6.0%,
    Mexico 4.0%, Russia 3.4%, Turkey 3.0%, the United States 2.2%, and
    Canada 1.9%, while among the 37, Brazil grew 1.3%, Germany 0.7%, France
    0.1%, Belgium -0.2%, Netherlands -0.5%, Spain -1.4%, and Italy -2.3%.
    The median unemployment rate for the 37 countries jumped to 11.5%,
    while the median for the pro-growth countries held steady at 7.3%.
    
    Faster GDP growth and lower unemployment rates translated into
    increased tax revenues and a lower debt burden. Revenues for the 85
    expansionary countries grew at a median rate of 10.8%, whereas tax
    revenues fell at a median rate of 6.2% for the 37 countries that chose
    austere economic policies. Budget balances improved for about half of
    the 37, but, for most, debt grew faster than GDP, and the median level
    of their public debt as a share of GDP increased 2.5 percentage points,
    to 57.8%. On the other hand, budget balances deteriorated for most of
    the 85 pro-growth countries, but GDP growth outpaced increases in debt,
    and the median level of public debt as a share of GDP actually declined
    slightly (-0.1 percentage points).
    
    The world recession has suppressed inflation rates - world inflation
    declined 1.0 percentage point in 2012 to about 4.0%. At the same time,
    the median inflation rate for the 85 pro-growth countries, at 5.5%, was
    2.5 percentage points higher than that for the countries that followed
    more austere fiscal and monetary policies. Overall, the latter
    countries also improved their current account balances by shedding
    imports; as a result, current account balances deteriorated for most of
    the countries that pursued pro-growth policies. Slower growth of world
    income reduced import demand and crude oil prices fell. Consequently,
    the dollar value of world trade grew just 1% in 2012, compared with 18%
    in 2011.
    
    Beyond the current global slowdown, the world faces several
    long-standing economic challenges. The addition of 80 million people
    each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems
    of pollution, waste-disposal, epidemics, water-shortages, famine,
    over-fishing of oceans, deforestation, desertification, and depletion
    of non-renewable resources. The nation-state, as a bedrock
    economic-political institution, is steadily losing control over
    international flows of people, goods, services, funds, and technology.
    The introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of Western
    Europe in January 1999, while paving the way for an integrated economic
    powerhouse, has created economic risks because the participating
    nations have varying income levels and growth rates, and hence, require
    a different mix of monetary and fiscal policies. Governments,
    especially in Western Europe, face the difficult political problem of
    channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase
    investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment. Because of
    their own internal problems and priorities, the industrialized
    countries are unable to devote sufficient resources to deal effectively
    with the poorer areas of the world, which, at least from an economic
    point of view, are becoming further marginalized. The terrorist attacks
    on the US on 11 September 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global
    prosperity - the diversion of resources away from capital investments
    to counter-terrorist programs.
    
    Despite these vexing problems, the world economy also shows great
    promise. Technology has made possible further advances in a wide range
    of fields, from agriculture, to medicine, alternative energy,
    metallurgy, and transportation. Improved global communications have
    greatly reduced the costs of international trade, helping the world
    gain from the international division of labor, raise living standards,
    and reduce income disparities among nations. Much of the resilience of
    the world economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis resulted
    from government and central bank leaders around the globe working in
    concert to stem the financial onslaught, knowing well the lessons of
    past economic failures.

    robotics, telecommunications, and medicines and medical equipment; most
    of these advances take place in OECD nations; only a small portion of
    non-OECD countries have succeeded in rapidly adjusting to these

    typically; national inflation rates vary widely in individual cases;
    inflation rates have declined for most countries for the last several
    years, held in check by increasing international competition from

  Transportation - note:
    the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) reports that 2011 saw a very
    slight (1%) decrease in global pirate activities with marginally fewer
    people taken hostage at sea; in 2011, pirates attacked a total of 439
    ships world-wide including hijacking 45 ships, capturing 802 seafarers,
    and killing eight; while the Horn of Africa remains the most dangerous
    area for maritime shipping, accounting for more than 50% of all attacks
    in 2011, a number of attacks also occurred in the coastal waters of
    Indonesia, the South China Sea, Bangladesh, and West Africa; as of July
    2012, there were 189 attacks worldwide with 20 hijackings; the Horn of
    Africa remains the most dangerous region in 2012 with 70 attacks, 13
    hijackings, 212 hostages seized; as of July 2012, Somali pirates held
    11 vessels and 174 hostages; the decrease in successful pirate attacks
    is due, in part, to more aggressive anti-piracy operations by
    international naval forces as well as the increased use of armed
    security teams aboard merchant ships

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    stretching over 250,000 km, the world's 325 international land
    boundaries separate 195 independent states and 71 dependencies, areas
    of special sovereignty, and other miscellaneous entities; ethnicity,
    culture, race, religion, and language have divided states into separate
    political entities as much as history, physical terrain, political
    fiat, or conquest, resulting in sometimes arbitrary and imposed
    boundaries; most maritime states have claimed limits that include
    territorial seas and exclusive economic zones; overlapping limits due
    to adjacent or opposite coasts create the potential for 430 bilateral
    maritime boundaries of which 209 have agreements that include
    contiguous and non-contiguous segments; boundary, borderland/resource,
    and territorial disputes vary in intensity from managed or dormant to
    violent or militarized; undemarcated, indefinite, porous, and unmanaged
    boundaries tend to encourage illegal cross-border activities,
    uncontrolled migration, and confrontation; territorial disputes may
    evolve from historical and/or cultural claims, or they may be brought
    on by resource competition; ethnic and cultural clashes continue to be
    responsible for much of the territorial fragmentation and internal
    displacement of the estimated 20.8 million people and cross-border
    displacements of approximately 12.1 million refugees and asylum seekers
    around the world as of mid-2013; over half a million refugees were
    repatriated during 2012; other sources of contention include access to
    water and mineral (especially hydrocarbon) resources, fisheries, and
    arable land; armed conflict prevails not so much between the uniformed
    armed forces of independent states as between stateless armed entities
    that detract from the sustenance and welfare of local populations,
    leaving the community of nations to cope with resultant refugees,
    hunger, disease, impoverishment, and environmental degradation

  Refugees and internally displaced persons:
    the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated
    that as of the end of 2012 there were 45.2 million people forcibly
    displaced worldwide; this includes 15.4 million refugees, 937,000
    asylum seekers, and 28.8 million conflict IDPs (another 32.4 million
    IDPs were displaced by natural disasters); the UNHCR estimates there
    are currently 10-12 million stateless persons (2012)

  Trafficking in persons:
    current situation: approximately 800,000 people, mostly women and
    children, are trafficked annually across national borders, not
    including the millions who are trafficked within their own countries;
    at least 80% of the victims are female and up to 50% are minors; 75% of
    all victims are trafficked into commercial sexual exploitation; almost
    two-thirds of the global victims are trafficked intra-regionally within
    East Asia and the Pacific (260,000 to 280,000 people) and Europe and
    Eurasia (170,000 to 210,000 people) (2012)
    Tier 2 Watch List: (44 countries) Afghanistan, Albania, Angola,
    Bahrain, Barbados, Belarus, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Chad, Comoros,

    (2013)

  Illicit drugs:
    cocaine: worldwide coca leaf cultivation in 2007 amounted to 232,500
    hectares; Colombia produced slightly more than two-thirds of the
    worldwide crop, followed by Peru and Bolivia; potential pure cocaine
    production decreased 7% to 865 metric tons in 2007; Colombia conducts
    an aggressive coca eradication campaign, but both Peruvian and Bolivian
    Governments are hesitant to eradicate coca in key growing areas; 551
    metric tons of export-quality cocaine (85% pure) is documented to have
    been seized or destroyed in 2005; US consumption of export quality
    cocaine is estimated to have been in excess of 380 metric tons
