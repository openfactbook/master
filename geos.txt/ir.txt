Introduction

  Background:
    Known as Persia until 1935, Iran became an Islamic republic in 1979
    after the ruling monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad Reza PAHLAVI
    was forced into exile. Conservative clerical forces led by Ayatollah
    Ruhollah KHOMEINI established a theocratic system of government with
    ultimate political authority vested in a learned religious scholar
    referred to commonly as the Supreme Leader who, according to the
    constitution, is accountable only to the Assembly of Experts - a
    popularly elected 86-member body of clerics. US-Iranian relations
    became strained when a group of Iranian students seized the US Embassy
    in Tehran in November 1979 and held embassy personnel hostages until
    mid-January 1981. The US cut off diplomatic relations with Iran in
    April 1980. During the period 1980-88, Iran fought a bloody, indecisive
    war with Iraq that eventually expanded into the Persian Gulf and led to
    clashes between US Navy and Iranian military forces. Iran has been
    designated a state sponsor of terrorism for its activities in Lebanon
    and elsewhere in the world and remains subject to US, UN, and EU
    economic sanctions and export controls because of its continued
    involvement in terrorism and concerns over possible military dimensions
    of its nuclear program. Following the election of reformer Hojjat
    ol-Eslam Mohammad KHATAMI as president in 1997 and a reformist Majles
    (legislature) in 2000, a campaign to foster political reform in
    response to popular dissatisfaction was initiated. The movement
    floundered as conservative politicians, supported by the Supreme
    Leader, unelected institutions of authority like the Council of
    Guardians, and the security services reversed and blocked reform
    measures while increasing security repression. Starting with nationwide
    municipal elections in 2003 and continuing through Majles elections in
    2004, conservatives reestablished control over Iran's elected
    government institutions, which culminated with the August 2005
    inauguration of hardliner Mahmud AHMADI-NEJAD as president. His
    controversial reelection in June 2009 sparked nationwide protests over
    allegations of electoral fraud. These protests were quickly suppressed,
    and the political opposition that arouse as a consequence of
    AHMADI-NEJAD's election was repressed. Deteriorating economic
    conditions due primarily to government mismanagement and international
    sanctions prompted at least two major economically based protests in
    July and October 2012, but Iran's internal security situation remained
    stable. President AHMADI-NEJAD's independent streak angered regime
    establishment figures, including the Supreme Leader, leading to
    conservative opposition to his agenda for the last year of his
    presidency, and an alienation of his political supporters. In June 2013
    Iranians elected a moderate conservative cleric, Dr. Hasan Fereidun
    RUHANI to the presidency. He is a long-time senior member in the
    regime, but has made promises of reforming society and Iran's foreign
    policy. The UN Security Council has passed a number of resolutions
    calling for Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment and reprocessing
    activities and comply with its IAEA obligations and responsibilities,
    but in November 2013 the five permanent members, plus Germany, (P5+1)
    signed a joint plan with Iran to provide the country with incremental
    relief from international pressure for positive steps toward
    transparency of their nuclear program.

    Council of Guardians or Guardians Council (Shora-ye Negban-e Qanon-e
    Asasi) determines whether proposed legislation is both constitutional
    and faithful to Islamic law, vets candidates in popular elections for
    suitability, and supervises national elections; 2) Assembly of Experts
    (Majles-e Khoebregan), an elected consultative body of senior clerics
    constitutionally mandated to select, appoint, supervise, and dismiss
    the Supreme Leader; 3) Expediency Council or the Council for the
    Discernment of Expediency (Majma-ye- Tashkhis-e -Maslahat-e- Nezam)

  Political parties and leaders:
    note: formal political parties are a relatively new phenomenon in Iran
    and most conservatives still prefer to work through political pressure
    groups rather than parties; often political parties or coalitions are
    formed prior to elections and disbanded soon thereafter; a loose
    pro-reform coalition called the 2nd Khordad Front, which includes
    political parties as well as less formal groups and organizations,
    achieved considerable success in elections for the sixth Majles in
    early 2000; groups in the coalition included the Islamic Iran
    Participation Front (IIPF), Executives of Construction Party
    (Kargozaran), Solidarity Party, Islamic Labor Party, Mardom Salari,
    Mojahedin of the Islamic Revolution Organization (MIRO), and Militant
    Clerics Society (MCS; Ruhaniyun); the coalition participated in the
    seventh Majles elections in early 2004 but boycotted them after 80
    incumbent reformists were disqualified; following his defeat in the
    2005 presidential elections, former MCS Secretary General and sixth
    Majles Speaker Mehdi KARUBI formed the National Trust Party; a new
    conservative group, Islamic Iran Developers Coalition (Abadgaran), took
    a leading position in the new Majles after winning a majority of the
    seats in February 2004; ahead of the 2008 Majles elections, traditional
    and hardline conservatives attempted to close ranks under the United
    Front of Principlists and the Broad Popular Coalition of Principlists;
    several reformist groups, such as the MIRO and the IIPF, also came
    together as a reformist coalition in advance of the 2008 Majles
    elections; the IIPF has repeatedly complained that the overwhelming
    majority of its candidates were unfairly disqualified from the 2008
    elections

  Political pressure groups and leaders:
    groups that generally support the Islamic Republic: Ansar-e Hizballah;
    Followers of the Line of the Imam and the Leader; Islamic Coalition
    Party (Motalefeh); Islamic Engineers Society; Tehran Militant Clergy
    Association (MCA; Ruhaniyat);
    active pro-reform student group: Office of Strengthening Unity (OSU);
    opposition groups: Freedom Movement of Iran; Green Path movement [Mehdi
    KARUBI, Mir-Hosein MUSAVI]; Marz-e Por Gohar; National Front; various
    ethnic and monarchist organizations;
    armed political groups repressed by the government: Democratic Party of
    Iranian Kurdistan (KDPI); Harekat-e Ansar-e Iran (splinter faction of
    Jundallah); Jaysh l-Adl (formerly known as Jundallah); Komala;

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Iran's economy is marked by statist policies, an inefficient state
    sector, and reliance on oil, a major source of government revenues.
    Price controls, subsidies, and other distortions weigh down the
    economy, undermining the potential for private-sector-led growth.
    Private sector activity is typically limited to small-scale workshops,
    farming, some manufacturing, and services. Significant informal market
    activity flourishes and corruption is widespread. New fiscal and
    monetary constraints on Tehran, following the expansion of
    international sanctions in 2012 against Iran's Central Bank and oil
    exports, significantly reduced Iran's oil revenue, forced government
    spending cuts, and fueled a 60% currency depreciation. Economic growth
    turned negative in 2012 and 2013, for the first time in two decades.
    Iran continues to suffer from double-digit unemployment and
    underemployment. Lack of job opportunities has convinced many educated
    Iranian youth to seek jobs overseas, resulting in a significant "brain
    drain." However, the election of President Hasan RUHANI in June 2013
    brought about widespread expectations of economic improvements and
    greater international engagement among the Iranian public, and early in
    Ruhani's term the country saw a strengthened national currency and a
    historic boost to market values at the Tehran Stock Exchange.

  Telephone system:
    general assessment: currently being modernized and expanded with the
    goal of not only improving the efficiency and increasing the volume of
    the urban service but also bringing telephone service to several
    thousand villages, not presently connected
    domestic: the addition of new fiber cables and modern switching and
    exchange systems installed by Iran's state-owned telecom company have
    improved and expanded the fixed-line network greatly; fixed-line
    availability has more than doubled to more than 27 million lines since
    2000; additionally, mobile-cellular service has increased dramatically
    serving roughly 56 million subscribers in 2011; combined fixed and
    mobile-cellular subscribership now exceeds 100 per 100 persons
    international: country code - 98; submarine fiber-optic cable to UAE
    with access to Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe (FLAG);
    Trans-Asia-Europe (TAE) fiber-optic line runs from Azerbaijan through
    the northern portion of Iran to Turkmenistan with expansion to Georgia
    and Azerbaijan; HF radio and microwave radio relay to Turkey,
    Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Syria, Kuwait,
    Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan; satellite earth stations - 13 (9 Intelsat

    Arab in the Persian Gulf; Iran and UAE dispute Tunb Islands and Abu
    Musa Island, which are occupied by Iran; Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and
    Russia ratified Caspian seabed delimitation treaties based on

    the sea; Afghan and Iranian commissioners have discussed boundary
    monument densification and resurvey

  Trafficking in persons:
    current situation: Iran is a presumed source, transit, and destination
    country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking and
    forced labor; Iranian and Afghan boys and girls are forced into
    prostitution domestically; Iranian women are subjected to sex
    trafficking in Iran, Pakistan, the Persian Gulf, and Europe;
    Azerbaijani women and children are also sexually exploited in Iran;
    Afghan migrants and refugees and Pakistani men and women are subjected
    to conditions of forced labor in Iran; NGO reports indicate that

    tier rating: Tier 3 - Iran does not comply with the minimum standards
    for the elimination of trafficking, and is not making significant
    efforts to do so; the government does not share information on its
    anti-trafficking efforts, making it difficult to assess the country's
    human trafficking problem or the government's attempts to curb it; NGOs
    report that laws against human trafficking, forced labor, and debt
    bondage remain unenforced because of a lack of political will and
    widespread political corruption; there is no evidence that the
    government has a process to identify trafficking victims, refers
    victims to protective services, or has made efforts to prevent human
    trafficking (2013)

    measures along the border with Afghanistan, Iran remains one of the
    primary transshipment routes for Southwest Asian heroin to Europe;

    an increasing problem with synthetic drugs; lacks anti-money laundering
    laws; has reached out to neighboring countries to share counter-drug
    intelligence
