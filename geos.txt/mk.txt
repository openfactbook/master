Macedonia
=========


Introduction

  Background:
    Macedonia gained its independence peacefully from Yugoslavia in 1991.
    Greece's objection to the new state's use of what it considered a
    Hellenic name and symbols delayed international recognition, which
    occurred under the provisional designation of "the Former Yugoslav
    Republic of Macedonia." In 1995, Greece lifted a 20-month trade embargo
    and the two countries agreed to normalize relations, but the issue of
    the name remained unresolved and negotiations for a solution are
    ongoing. Since 2004, the US and over 130 other nations have recognized
    Macedonia by its constitutional name, Republic of Macedonia. Ethnic
    Albanian grievances over perceived political and economic inequities
    escalated into an insurgency in 2001 that eventually led to the
    internationally brokered Ohrid Framework Agreement, which ended the
    fighting and established guidelines for constitutional amendments and
    the creation of new laws that enhanced the rights of minorities.
    Although Macedonia became an EU candidate in 2005, the country still
    faces challenges, including fully implementing the Framework Agreement,
    improving relations with Bulgaria, carrying out democratic reforms, and
    stimulating economic growth and development. Macedonia's membership in
    NATO was blocked by Greece at the Alliance's Summit of Bucharest in
    2008.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Since its independence in 1991, Macedonia has made significant progress
    in liberalizing its economy and improving its business environment, but
    has lagged the Balkan region in attracting foreign investment.
    Unemployment has remained consistently high at more than 30% since
    2008, but may be overstated based on the existence of an extensive gray
    market, estimated to be between 20% and 45% of GDP, that is not
    captured by official statistics. Macedonia’s economy is closely
    linked to Europe as a customer for exports and source of investment,
    and has suffered as a result of prolonged weakness in the euro zone.
    Macedonia maintained macroeconomic stability through the global
    financial crisis by conducting prudent monetary policy, which keeps the
    domestic currency pegged against the euro, and by limiting fiscal
    deficits. The government has been loosening fiscal policy, however, and
    the budget deficit expanded to 4.2% of GDP in 2013. Macedonia achieved
    modest GDP growth in 2013 after a small contraction in 2012; inflation
    is under control.
