Introduction

  Background:
    Founding president and liberation struggle icon Jomo KENYATTA led Kenya
    from independence in 1963 until his death in 1978, when President
    Daniel MOI took power in a constitutional succession. The country was a
    de facto one-party state from 1969 until 1982 when the ruling Kenya
    African National Union (KANU) made itself the sole legal party in
    Kenya. MOI acceded to internal and external pressure for political
    liberalization in late 1991. The ethnically fractured opposition failed
    to dislodge KANU from power in elections in 1992 and 1997, which were
    marred by violence and fraud, but were viewed as having generally
    reflected the will of the Kenyan people. President MOI stepped down in
    December 2002 following fair and peaceful elections. Mwai KIBAKI,
    running as the candidate of the multiethnic, united opposition group,
    the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC), defeated KANU candidate Uhuru
    KENYATTA and assumed the presidency following a campaign centered on an
    anticorruption platform. KIBAKI's NARC coalition splintered in 2005
    over a constitutional review process. Government defectors joined with
    KANU to form a new opposition coalition, the Orange Democratic Movement
    (ODM), which defeated the government's draft constitution in a popular
    referendum in November 2005. KIBAKI's reelection in December 2007
    brought charges of vote rigging from ODM candidate Raila ODINGA and
    unleashed two months of violence in which as many as 1,500 people died.
    African Union-sponsored mediation led by former UN Secretary General
    Kofi ANNAN in late February 2008 resulted in a power-sharing accord
    bringing ODINGA into the government in the restored position of prime
    minister. The power sharing accord included a broad reform agenda, the
    centerpiece of which was constitutional reform. In August 2010, Kenyans
    overwhelmingly adopted a new constitution in a national referendum. The
    new constitution introduced additional checks and balances to executive
    power and significant devolution of power and resources to 47 newly
    created counties. It also eliminated the position of prime minister
    following the first presidential election under the new constitution,
    which occurred on 4 March 2013. Uhuru KENYATTA, the son of founding
    president Jomo KENYATTA, won the March elections in the first round by
    a close margin and was sworn into office on 9 April 2013.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Kenya hKenya has been hampered by corruption and by reliance upon
    several primary goods whose prices have remained low. Low
    infrastructure investment threatens Kenya's long-term position as the
    largest East African economy, although the Kenyatta administration has
    prioritized infrastructure development. International financial lenders
    and donors remain important to Kenya's economic growth and development.
    Unemployment is high at around 40%. The country has chronic budget
    deficits. Inflationary pressures and sharp currency depreciation peaked
    in early 2012 but have since abated following low global food and fuel
    prices and monetary interventions by the Central Bank. Recent terrorism
    in Kenya and the surrounding region threatens Kenya's important tourism
    industry. Kenya, in conjunction with neighboring Ethiopia and South
    Sudan, intends to begin construction on a transport corridor and oil
    pipeline into the port of Lamu in 2014.

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    Kenya served as an important mediator in brokering Sudan's north-south
    separation in February 2005; Kenya provides shelter to an estimated 550
    million refugees, including Ugandans who flee across the border
    periodically to seek protection from Lord's Resistance Army rebels;
    Kenya works hard to prevent the clan and militia fighting in Somalia
    from spreading across the border, which has long been open to nomadic
    pastoralists; the boundary that separates Kenya's and Sudan's
    sovereignty is unclear in the "Ilemi Triangle," which Kenya has
    administered since colonial times

  Refugees and internally displaced persons:
    refugees (country of origin): 425,879 (Somalia); 84,045 (South Sudan);
    29,723 (Ethiopia); 15,290 (Democratic Republic of Congo - includes
    registered asylum seekers); 8,769 (Sudan - includes registered asylum
    seekers); 5,825 (Burundi - includes registered asylum seekers) (2014)
    IDPs: 412,000 (represents people displaced since the 1990s by ethnic
    and political violence and land disputes and who sought refuge mostly
    in camps; persons who took refuge in host communities or were evicted
    in urban areas are not included in the data; data is not available on
    pastoralists displaced by cattle rustling, violence, natural disasters,
    and development projects; the largest displacement resulted from
    2007-08 post-election violence (2013)
    stateless persons: 20,000 (2012); note - the stateless population is
    composed of Nubians, Kenyan Somalis, and coastal Arabs; the Nubians are
    descendants of Sudanese soldiers recruited by the British to fight for
    them in East Africa more than a century ago; they did not receive
    Kenyan citizenship when the country became independent in 1963; only
    recently have Nubians become a formally recognized tribe and had less
    trouble obtaining national IDs; Galjeel and other Somalis who have
    lived in Kenya for decades are lumped in with more recent Somali
    refugees and denied ID cards

  Trafficking in persons:
    current situation: Kenya is a source, transit, and destination country
    for adults and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking;
    Kenyan children are forced to work in domestic service, agriculture,
    fishing, cattle herding, street vending, begging, and prostitution;
    Kenyan economic migrants to other East African countries, South Sudan,
    Europe, the US, and the Middle East are at times exploited in domestic
    servitude, massage parlors or brothels, or forced manual labor;
    children from Burundi, Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, and
    Uganda are subjected to forced labor and prostitution in Kenya; Somali
    refugees living in the Dadaab complex may be forced into prostitution
    or work on tobacco farms
    tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Kenya does not fully comply with the
    minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; the government
    enacted the Counter-Trafficking in Persons Act in October 2012 but has
    not launched and implemented its national plan of action, convened the
    Counter-Trafficking in Persons Advisory Committee, taken tangible
    action against trafficking complicity among law enforcement officials,
    provided shelter and other protective services for adult victims,
    monitor the work of overseas labor recruitment agencies, or provide
    wide-scale anti-trafficking training to its officials; efforts to
    assist and care for child victims remain strong; corruption among
    officials continue to hamper efforts to bring traffickers to justice
    (2013)

  Illicit drugs:
    widespread harvesting of small plots of marijuana; transit country for
    South Asian heroin destined for Europe and North America; Indian
    methaqualone also transits on way to South Africa; significant
    potential for money-laundering activity given the country's status as a
    regional financial center; massive corruption, and relatively high
    levels of narcotics-associated activities
