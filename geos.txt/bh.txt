Belize

Introduction

  Background:
    Belize was the site of several Mayan city states until their decline at
    the end of the first millennium A.D. The British and Spanish disputed
    the region in the 17th and 18th centuries; it formally became the
    colony of British Honduras in 1854. Territorial disputes between the UK
    and Guatemala delayed the independence of Belize until 1981. Guatemala
    refused to recognize the new nation until 1992 and the two countries
    are involved in an ongoing border dispute. Tourism has become the
    mainstay of the economy. Current concerns include the country's heavy
    foreign debt burden, high unemployment, growing involvement in the
    Mexican and South American drug trade, high crime rates, and one of the
    highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rates in Central America.

People and Society

  Nationality:
    noun: Belizean(s)
    adjective: Belizean

  Ethnic groups:
    mestizo 48.7%, Creole 24.9%, Maya 10.6%, Garifuna 6.1%, other 9.7%
    (2000 census)

  Languages:
    Spanish 46%, Creole 32.9%, Mayan dialects 8.9%, English 3.9%
    (official), Garifuna 3.4% (Carib), German 3.3%, other 1.4%, unknown
    0.2% (2000 census)

  Religions:
    Roman Catholic 39.3%, Pentacostal 8.3%, Seventh Day Adventist 5.3%,
    Anglican 4.5%, Mennonite 3.7%, Baptist 3.5%, Methodist 2.8%, Nazarene

    Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Mormon), other (unknown) 3.1%, none
    15.2% (2010 census)

  Demographic profile:
    Migration continues to transform Belize's population. About 16% of
    Belizeans live abroad, while immigrants constitute approximately 15% of
    Belize's population. Belizeans seeking job and educational
    opportunities have preferred to emigrate to the United States rather
    than former colonizer Great Britain because of the United States'
    closer proximity and stronger trade ties with Belize. Belizeans also
    emigrate to Canada, Mexico, and English-speaking Caribbean countries.
    The emigration of a large share of Creoles (Afro-Belizeans) and the
    influx of Central American immigrants, mainly Guatemalans, Salvadorans,
    and Hondurans, has changed Belize's ethnic composition. Mestizos have
    become the largest ethnic group, and Belize now has more native Spanish
    speakers than English or Creole speakers, despite English being the
    official language. In addition, Central American immigrants are
    establishing new communities in rural areas, which contrasts with the
    urbanization trend seen in neighboring countries. Recently, Chinese,
    European, and North American immigrants have become more frequent.
    Immigration accounts for an increasing share of Belize's population
    growth rate, which is steadily falling due to fertility decline.
    Belize's declining birth rate and its increased life expectancy are
    creating an aging population. As the elderly population grows and
    nuclear families replace extended households, Belize's government will
    be challenged to balance a rising demand for pensions, social services,
    and healthcare for its senior citizens with the need to reduce poverty
    and social inequality and to improve sanitation.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Tourism is the number one foreign exchange earner in this small
    economy, followed by exports of marine products, citrus, cane sugar,
    bananas, and garments. The government's expansionary monetary and
    fiscal policies, initiated in September 1998, led to GDP growth
    averaging nearly 4% in 1999-2007. Oil discoveries in 2006 bolstered
    this growth. Exploration efforts have continued and production has
    increased a small amount. Growth slipped to 0% in 2009, resulting from
    the global economic slowdown, natural disasters, and a temporary drop
    in the price of oil, but grew to 2.5% in 2013. With weak economic
    growth and a large public debt burden, fiscal spending is likely to be
    tight. In January 2013, the government announced that it had reached a
    deal with creditors to restructure its $544 million commercial external
    debt, commonly referred to as the "superbond." The superbond represents
    one half of the country's public debt. A key government objective
    remains the reduction of poverty and inequality with the help of
    international donors. Although Belize has the second highest per capita
    income in Central America, the average income figure masks a huge
    income disparity between rich and poor. The sizable trade deficit and
    heavy foreign debt burden continue to be major concerns.
