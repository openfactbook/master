Nauru
=====


Introduction

  Background:
    The exact origins of the Nauruans are unclear since their language does
    not resemble any other in the Pacific region. Germany annexed the
    island in 1888. A German-British consortium began mining the island's
    phosphate deposits early in the 20th century. Australian forces
    occupied Nauru in World War I; it subsequently became a League of
    Nations mandate. After the Second World War - and a brutal occupation
    by Japan - Nauru became a UN trust territory. It achieved independence
    in 1968 and joined the UN in 1999 as the world's smallest independent
    republic.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Revenues of this tiny island traditionally have come from exports of
    phosphates. Few other resources exist, with most necessities being
    imported, mainly from Australia, its former occupier and later major
    source of support. In 2005 an Australian company entered into an
    agreement to exploit remaining supplies. Primary reserves of phosphates
    were exhausted and mining ceased in 2006, but mining of a deeper layer
    of "secondary phosphate" in the interior of the island began the
    following year. The secondary phosphate deposits may last another 30
    years. The rehabilitation of mined land and the replacement of income
    from phosphates are serious long-term problems. In anticipation of the
    exhaustion of Nauru's phosphate deposits, substantial amounts of
    phosphate income were invested in trust funds to help cushion the
    transition and provide for Nauru's economic future. As a result of
    heavy spending from the trust funds, the government faced virtual
    bankruptcy. To cut costs the government has frozen wages and reduced
    overstaffed public service departments. Nauru lost further revenue in
    2008 with the closure of Australia's refugee processing center, making
    it almost totally dependent on food imports and foreign aid. Housing,
    hospitals, and other capital plant are deteriorating. The cost to
    Australia of keeping the government and economy afloat continues to
    climb. Few comprehensive statistics on the Nauru economy exist with
    estimates of Nauru's GDP varying widely.
