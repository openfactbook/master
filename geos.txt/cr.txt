Coral Sea Islands
=================

(territory of Australia)


Introduction

  Background:
    Scattered over more than three-quarters of a million square kilometers
    of ocean, the Coral Sea Islands were declared a territory of Australia
    in 1969. They are uninhabited except for a small meteorological staff
    on the Willis Islets. Automated weather stations, beacons, and a
    lighthouse occupy many other islands and reefs. The Coral Sea Islands
    Act 1969 was amended in 1997 to extend the boundaries of the Coral Sea
    Islands Territory around Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs.
