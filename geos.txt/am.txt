Introduction

  Background:
    Armenia prides itself on being the first nation to formally adopt
    Christianity (early 4th century). Despite periods of autonomy, over the
    centuries Armenia came under the sway of various empires including the
    Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Persian, and Ottoman. During World War I in the
    western portion of Armenia, Ottoman Turkey instituted a policy of
    forced resettlement coupled with other harsh practices that resulted in
    at least 1 million Armenian deaths. The eastern area of Armenia was
    ceded by the Ottomans to Russia in 1828; this portion declared its
    independence in 1918, but was conquered by the Soviet Red Army in 1920.
    Armenian leaders remain preoccupied by the long conflict with
    Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, a primarily Armenian-populated
    region, assigned to Soviet Azerbaijan in the 1920s by Moscow. Armenia
    and Azerbaijan began fighting over the area in 1988; the struggle
    escalated after both countries attained independence from the Soviet
    Union in 1991. By May 1994, when a cease-fire took hold, ethnic
    Armenian forces held not only Nagorno-Karabakh but also a significant
    portion of Azerbaijan proper. The economies of both sides have been
    hurt by their inability to make substantial progress toward a peaceful
    resolution. Turkey closed the common border with Armenia in 1993 in
    support of Azerbaijan in its conflict with Armenia over control of
    Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas, further hampering Armenian
    economic growth. In 2009, senior Armenian leaders began pursuing
    rapprochement with Turkey, aiming to secure an opening of the border,
    but Turkey has not yet ratified the Protocols normalizing relations
    between the two countries. In September 2013, President SARGSIAN
    announced Armenia would join Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan as a
    member of the Eurasian Economic Union.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    After several years of double-digit economic growth, Armenia faced a
    severe economic recession with GDP declining more than 14% in 2009,
    despite large loans from multilateral institutions. Sharp declines in
    the construction sector and workers' remittances, particularly from
    Russia, led the downturn. The economy began to recover in 2010 with
    2.1% growth, and has grown even faster in the three years since then.
    Under the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia developed a
    modern industrial sector, supplying machine tools, textiles, and other
    manufactured goods to sister republics, in exchange for raw materials
    and energy. Armenia has since switched to small-scale agriculture and
    away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era.
    Armenia's geographic isolation, a narrow export base, and pervasive
    monopolies in important business sectors have made it particularly
    vulnerable to the sharp deterioration in the global economy and the
    economic downturn in Russia. Since August 2011, Armenia has experienced
    a sharp currency depreciation. Armenia has only two open trade borders
    - Iran and Georgia - because its borders with Azerbaijan and Turkey
    have been closed since 1991 and 1993, respectively, as a result of
    Armenia's ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the separatist
    Nagorno-Karabakh region. Armenia is particularly dependent on Russian
    commercial and governmental support and most key Armenian
    infrastructure is Russian-owned and/or managed, especially in the
    energy sector. The electricity distribution system was privatized in
    2002 and bought by Russia's RAO-UES in 2005. Natural gas is primarily
    imported from Russia but construction of a pipeline to deliver natural
    gas from Iran to Armenia was completed in December 2008, and gas
    deliveries expanded after the April 2010 completion of the Yerevan
    Thermal Power Plant. Armenia's severe trade imbalance has been offset
    somewhat by international aid, remittances from Armenians working
    abroad, and foreign direct investment. Armenia joined the WTO in
    January 2003. The government made some improvements in tax and customs
    administration in recent years, but anti-corruption measures have been
    ineffective and the economic downturn has led to a sharp drop in tax
    revenue and forced the government to accept large loan packages from
    Russia, the IMF, and other international financial institutions.
    Amendments to tax legislation, including the introduction of the first
    ever "luxury tax" in 2011, aim to increase the ratio of budget revenues
    to GDP, which still remains at low levels. Armenia will need to pursue
    additional economic reforms and to strengthen the rule of law in order
    to regain economic growth and improve economic competitiveness and
    employment opportunities, especially given its economic isolation from
    two of its nearest neighbors, Turkey and Azerbaijan.
