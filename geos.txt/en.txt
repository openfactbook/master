Introduction

  Background:
    After centuries of Danish, Swedish, German, and Russian rule, Estonia
    attained independence in 1918. Forcibly incorporated into the USSR in
    1940 - an action never recognized by the US - it regained its freedom
    in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since the last Russian
    troops left in 1994, Estonia has been free to promote economic and
    political ties with the West. It joined both NATO and the EU in the
    spring of 2004, formally joined the OECD in late 2010, and adopted the
    euro as its official currency on 1 January 2011.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Estonia, a member of the European Union and the eurozone since 2004,
    has a modern market-based economy and one of the higher per capita
    income levels in Central Europe and the Baltic region. Estonia's
    successive governments have pursued a free market, pro-business
    economic agenda and have wavered little in their commitment to
    pro-market reforms. The current government has followed sound fiscal
    policies that have resulted in balanced budgets and low public debt.
    The economy benefits from strong electronics and telecommunications
    sectors and strong trade ties with Finland, Sweden, Russia, and
    Germany. Estonia's economy fell into recession in mid-2008, as a result
    of an investment and consumption slump following the bursting of the
    real estate market bubble and a decrease in export demand as result of
    economic slowdown in the rest of Europe, but the economy has recovered
    strongly in the last five years. Growth was expected to top 2% in 2014,
    before the events in Ukraine. Estonia adopted the euro on 1 January
    2011.

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    Russia and Estonia in May 2005 signed a technical border agreement, but
    Russia in June 2005 recalled its signature after the Estonian
    parliament added to its domestic ratification act a historical preamble
    referencing the Soviet occupation and Estonia's pre-war borders under
    the 1920 Treaty of Tartu; Russia contends that the preamble allows
    Estonia to make territorial claims on Russia in the future, while
    Estonian officials deny that the preamble has any legal impact on the
    treaty text; Russia demands better treatment of the Russian-speaking
    population in Estonia; as a member state that forms part of the EU's
    external border, Estonia implements strict Schengen border rules with
    Russia

  Refugees and internally displaced persons:
    stateless persons: 94,235 (2012); note - following independence in
    1991, automatic citizenship was restricted to those who were Estonian
    citizens prior to the 1940 Soviet occupation and their descendants;
    thousands of ethnic Russians remained stateless when forced to choose
    between passing Estonian language and citizenship tests or applying for
    Russian citizenship; one reason for demurring on Estonian citizenship
    was to retain the right of visa-free travel to Russia; stateless
    residents can vote in local elections but not general elections;
    stateless parents who have been lawful residents of Estonia for at
    least five years can apply for citizenship for their children before
    they turn 15

  Illicit drugs:
    growing producer of synthetic drugs; increasingly important
    transshipment zone for cannabis, cocaine, opiates, and synthetic drugs
    since joining the European Union and the Schengen Accord; potential
    money laundering related to organized crime and drug trafficking is a
    concern, as is possible use of the gambling sector to launder funds;
    major use of opiates and ecstasy
