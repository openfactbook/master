Madagascar
==========


Introduction

  Background:
    Formerly an independent kingdom, Madagascar became a French colony in
    1896 but regained independence in 1960. During 1992-93, free
    presidential and National Assembly elections were held ending 17 years
    of single-party rule. In 1997, in the second presidential race, Didier
    RATSIRAKA, the leader during the 1970s and 1980s, was returned to the
    presidency. The 2001 presidential election was contested between the
    followers of Didier RATSIRAKA and Marc RAVALOMANANA, nearly causing
    secession of half of the country. In April 2002, the High
    Constitutional Court announced RAVALOMANANA the winner. RAVALOMANANA
    achieved a second term following a landslide victory in the generally
    free and fair presidential elections of 2006. In early 2009, protests
    over increasing restrictions on opposition press and activities
    resulted in RAVALOMANANA handing over power to the military, which then
    conferred the presidency on the mayor of Antananarivo, Andry RAJOELINA,
    in what amounted to a coup d'etat. Following a lengthy mediation
    process led by the Southern African Development Community (SADC),
    Madagascar held UN-supported presidential and parliamentary elections
    in 2013. Former de facto finance minister Hery RAJAONARIMAMPIANINA
    defeated RAVALOMANANA's favored candidate Jean-Louis ROBINSON in a
    presidential runoff and was inaugurated in January 2014. Most
    international observers, while noting some irregularities, declared
    polls to be a credible reflection of the Malagasy public's will.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    After discarding socialist economic policies in the mid-1990s,
    Madagascar followed a World Bank- and IMF-led policy of privatization
    and liberalization that has been undermined since the start of the
    political crisis. This strategy placed the country on a slow and steady
    growth path from an extremely low level. Agriculture, including fishing
    and forestry, is a mainstay of the economy, accounting for more than
    one-fourth of GDP and employing 80% of the population. Exports of
    apparel boomed in recent years primarily due to duty-free access to the
    US; however, Madagascar's failure to comply with the requirements of
    the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) led to the termination of
    the country's duty-free access in January 2010 and a sharp fall in
    textile production. Deforestation and erosion, aggravated by the use of
    firewood as the primary source of fuel, are serious concerns. The
    current political crisis, which began in early 2009, has dealt
    additional blows to the economy. Tourism dropped more than 50% in 2009
    compared with the previous year, and many investors are wary of
    entering the uncertain investment environment. Growth was slow during
    2010 to 2013 although expansion in mining and agricultural sectors is
    expected to contribute to more growth in 2014. International
    organizations and foreign donors are expected to resume development aid
    to Madagascar once RAJAONARIMAMPIANINA appoints a new government.

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    claims Bassas da India, Europa Island, Glorioso Islands, and Juan de
    Nova Island (all administered by France); the vegetated drying cays of
    Banc du Geyser, which were claimed by Madagascar in 1976, also fall
    within the EEZ claims of the Comoros and France (Glorioso Islands, part
    of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands)

  Trafficking in persons:
    current situation: Madagascar is a source country for men, women, and
    children subjected to forced labor and women and children subjected to
    sex trafficking; poor Malagasy women hired as domestic workers in
    Lebanon and Kuwait are vulnerable to abuse by recruitment agencies and
    employers; an increasing number of Malagasy men were victimized by
    labor trafficking abroad in 2012; Malagasy children are subjected to
    domestic servitude, prostitution, forced begging, and forced labor
    within the country, often with the complicity of family members;
    coastal cities have child sex tourism trades, with Malagasy men being
    the main clients
    tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Madagascar does not fully comply with
    the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it
    is making significant efforts to do so; law enforcement authorities
    have made a significant increase in efforts in 2012, resulting in 30
    trafficking-related prosecutions and two convictions; public officials
    complicity in human trafficking, however, remains a significant
    problem; the government has failed to identify and refer victims to
    protective services and has not supported NGO-run care facilities; the
    government also has not engaged any Middle Eastern governments
    regarding the protection of and legal remedies for Malagasy workers
    exploited abroad (2013)

  Illicit drugs:
    illicit producer of cannabis (cultivated and wild varieties) used
    mostly for domestic consumption; transshipment point for heroin
