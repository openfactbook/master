Introduction

    most prosperous countries with strong international trading links (its
    port is one of the world's busiest in terms of tonnage handled) and
    with per capita GDP equal to that of the leading nations of Western
    Europe.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Singapore has a highly developed and successful free-market economy. It
    enjoys a remarkably open and corruption-free environment, stable
    prices, and a per capita GDP higher than that of most developed
    countries. The economy depends heavily on exports, particularly in
    consumer electronics, information technology products, pharmaceuticals,
    and on a growing financial services sector. The economy contracted 0.6%
    in 2009 as a result of the global financial crisis, but rebounded 15.1%
    in 2010, on the strength of renewed exports, before slowing to in
    2011-13, largely a result of soft demand for exports during the second
    European recession. Over the longer term, the government hopes to
    establish a new growth path that focuses on raising productivity.
    Singapore has attracted major investments in pharmaceuticals and
    medical technology production and will continue efforts to establish
    Singapore as Southeast Asia's financial and high-tech hub.

    major container port(s) (TEUs): Singapore

  Transportation - note:
    the International Maritime Bureau reports the territorial and offshore
    waters in the South China Sea as high risk for piracy and armed robbery
    against ships; numerous commercial vessels have been attacked and
    hijacked both at anchor and while underway; hijacked vessels are often
    disguised and cargo diverted to ports in East Asia; crews have been
    murdered or cast adrift

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    disputes persist with Malaysia over deliveries of fresh water to
    Singapore, Singapore's extensive land reclamation works, bridge
    construction, and maritime boundaries in the Johor and Singapore
    Straits; in 2008, ICJ awarded sovereignty of Pedra Branca (Pulau Batu
    Puteh/Horsburgh Island) to Singapore, and Middle Rocks to Malaysia, but
    did not rule on maritime regimes, boundaries, or disposition of South
    Ledge; Indonesia and Singapore continue to work on finalization of
    their 1973 maritime boundary agreement by defining unresolved areas
    north of Indonesia's Batam Island; piracy remains a problem in the
    Malacca Strait

  Illicit drugs:
    drug abuse limited because of aggressive law enforcement efforts; as a
    transportation and financial services hub, Singapore is vulnerable,
    despite strict laws and enforcement, as a venue for money laundering
