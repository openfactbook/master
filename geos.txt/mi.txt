Malawi
======


Introduction

  Background:
    Established in 1891, the British protectorate of Nyasaland became the
    independent nation of Malawi in 1964. After three decades of one-party
    rule under President Hastings Kamuzu BANDA the country held multiparty
    elections in 1994, under a provisional constitution that came into full
    effect the following year. President Bingu wa MUTHARIKA, elected in May
    2004 after a failed attempt by the previous president to amend the
    constitution to permit another term, struggled to assert his authority
    against his predecessor and subsequently started his own party, the
    Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in 2005. MUTHARIKA was reelected to
    a second term in May 2009. He oversaw some economic improvement in his
    first term, but was accused of economic mismanagement and poor
    governance in his second term. He died abruptly in April 2012 and was
    succeeded by his vice president, Joyce BANDA, who had earlier started
    her own party, the People's Party (PP). Population growth, increasing
    pressure on agricultural lands, corruption, and the scourge of HIV/AIDS
    pose major problems for Malawi.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Landlocked Malawi ranks among the world's most densely populated and
    least developed countries. The economy is predominately agricultural
    with about 80% of the population living in rural areas. Agriculture,
    which has benefited from fertilizer subsidies since 2006, accounts for
    one-third of GDP and 90% of export revenues. The performance of the
    tobacco sector is key to short-term growth as tobacco accounts for more
    than half of exports. The economy depends on substantial inflows of
    economic assistance from the IMF, the World Bank, and individual donor
    nations. In 2006, Malawi was approved for relief under the Heavily
    Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program. In December 2007, the US
    granted Malawi eligibility status to receive financial support within
    the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) initiative. The government
    faces many challenges including developing a market economy, improving
    educational facilities, facing up to environmental problems, dealing
    with the rapidly growing problem of HIV/AIDS, and satisfying foreign
    donors that fiscal discipline is being tightened. Between 2005 and 2009
    President BANDA'S government exhibited improved financial discipline
    under the guidance of Finance Minister Goodall GONDWE and signed a
    three year IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) worth $56
    million. The government announced infrastructure projects that could
    yield improvements, such as a new oil pipeline for better fuel access,
    and the potential for a waterway link through Mozambican rivers to the
    ocean for better transportation options. Since 2009, however, Malawi
    has experienced some setbacks, including a general shortage of foreign
    exchange, which has damaged its ability to pay for imports, and fuel
    shortages that hinder transportation and productivity. Investment has
    fallen continuously for several years and in 2013 amounted to just 13%
    of GDP. The government has failed to address barriers to investment
    such as unreliable power, water shortages, poor telecommunications
    infrastructure, and the high costs of services. Donors, who provided an
    average of 36% of government revenue in the past five years, suspended
    general budget support for Malawi in 2011 due to a negative IMF review
    and governance issues.

Transnational Issues

    dispute with Tanzania over the boundary in Lake Nyasa (Lake Malawi) and

    when Malawi awarded a license to a British company for oil exploration
    in the lake
