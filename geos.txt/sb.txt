  Flag description:
    a yellow three-masted sailing ship facing the hoist side rides on a
    blue background with scattered, white, wavy lines under the ship; a
    continuous black-over-white wavy line divides the ship from the white
    wavy lines; on the hoist side, a vertical band is divided into three
    parts: the top part (called ikkurina) is red with a green diagonal
    cross extending to the corners overlaid by a white cross dividing the
    rectangle into four sections; the middle part has a white background
    with an ermine pattern; the third part has a red background with two
    stylized yellow lions outlined in black, one above the other; these
    three heraldic arms represent settlement by colonists from the Basque
    Country (top), Brittany, and Normandy; the blue on the main portion of
    the flag symbolizes the Atlantic Ocean and the stylized ship represents
    the Grande Hermine in which Jacques Cartier "discovered" the islands in
    1536

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    The inhabitants have traditionally earned their livelihood by fishing
    and by servicing fishing fleets operating off the coast of
    Newfoundland. The economy has been declining, however, because of
    disputes with Canada over fishing quotas and a steady decline in the
    number of ships stopping at Saint Pierre. In 1992, an arbitration panel
    awarded the islands an exclusive economic zone of 12,348 sq km to
    settle a longstanding territorial dispute with Canada, although it
    represents only 25% of what France had sought. France heavily
    subsidizes the islands to the great betterment of living standards. The
    government hopes an expansion of tourism will boost economic prospects.
    Fish farming, crab fishing, and agriculture are being developed to
    diversify the local economy. Recent test drilling for oil may pave the
    way for development of the energy sector.
