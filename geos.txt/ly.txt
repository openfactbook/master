Libya
=====


Introduction

  Background:
    The Italians supplanted the Ottoman Turks in the area around Tripoli in
    1911 and did not relinquish their hold until 1943 when defeated in
    World War II. Libya then passed to UN administration and achieved
    independence in 1951. Following a 1969 military coup, Col. Muammar
    al-QADHAFI assumed leadership and began to espouse his political system
    at home, which was a combination of socialism and Islam. During the
    1970s, QADHAFI used oil revenues to promote his ideology outside Libya,
    supporting subversive and terrorist activities that included the
    downing of two airliners - one over Scotland, another in Northern
    Africa - and a discotheque bombing in Berlin. UN sanctions in 1992
    isolated QADHAFI politically and economically following the attacks;
    sanctions were lifted in 2003 following Libyan acceptance of
    responsibility for the bombings and agreement to claimant compensation.
    QADHAFI also agreed to end Libya's program to develop weapons of mass
    destruction, and he made significant strides in normalizing relations
    with Western nations. Unrest that began in several Middle Eastern and
    North African countries in late 2010 erupted in Libyan cities in early
    2011. QADHAFI's brutal crackdown on protesters spawned a civil war that
    triggered UN authorization of air and naval intervention by the
    international community. After months of seesaw fighting between
    government and opposition forces, the QADHAFI regime was toppled in
    mid-2011 and replaced by a transitional government. Libya in 2012
    formed a new parliament and elected a new prime minister.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Libya's economy is structured primarily around the nation's energy
    sector, which generates about 95% of export earnings, 80% of GDP, and
    99% of government income. Substantial revenue from the energy sector
    coupled with a small population give Libya one of the highest per
    capita GDPs in Africa, but Tripoli largely has not used its significant
    financial resources to develop national infrastructure or the economy,
    leaving many citizens poor. In the final five years of QADHAFI's rule,
    Libya made some progress on economic reform as part of a broader
    campaign to reintegrate the country into the international fold. This
    effort picked up steam after UN sanctions were lifted in September 2003
    and after Libya announced in December 2003 that it would abandon
    programs to build weapons of mass destruction. The process of lifting
    US unilateral sanctions began in the spring of 2004; all sanctions were
    removed by June 2006, helping Libya attract greater foreign direct
    investment, especially in the energy and banking sectors. Libyan oil
    and gas licensing rounds drew high international interest, but new
    rounds are unlikely to be successful until Libya establishes a more
    permanent government and is able to offer more attractive financial
    terms on contracts and increase security. Libya faces a long road ahead
    in liberalizing its primarily socialist economy, but the revolution has
    unleashed previously restrained entrepreneurial activity and increased
    the potential for the evolution of a more market-based economy. The
    service and construction sectors expanded over the past five years and
    could become a larger share of GDP if Tripoli prioritizes capital
    spending on development projects once political and security
    uncertainty subside. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit
    agricultural output, and Libya imports about 80% of its food. Libya's
    primary agricultural water source is the Great Manmade River Project.
