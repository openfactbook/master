Introduction

  Background:
    Britain oversaw foreign relations and defense for the ruling Kuwaiti
    AL-SABAH dynasty from 1899 until independence in 1961. Kuwait was
    attacked and overrun by Iraq on 2 August 1990. Following several weeks
    of aerial bombardment, a US-led, UN coalition began a ground assault on
    23 February 1991 that liberated Kuwait in four days. Kuwait spent more
    than $5 billion to repair oil infrastructure damaged during 1990-91.
    The AL-SABAH family has ruled since returning to power in 1991 and
    reestablished an elected legislature that in recent years has become
    increasingly assertive. The country witnessed the historic election in
    2009 of four women to its National Assembly. Amid the 2010-11 uprisings
    and protests across the Arab world, stateless Arabs, known as bidun,
    staged small protests in February and March 2011 demanding citizenship,
    jobs, and other benefits available to Kuwaiti nationals. Youth activist
    groups - supported by opposition legislators - rallied repeatedly in
    2011 for the prime minister's dismissal amid allegations of widespread
    government corruption. Demonstrators forced the prime minister to
    resign in late 2011. In late 2012, Kuwait witnessed unprecedented
    protests in response to the Amir's changes to the electoral law by
    decree reducing the number of votes per person from four to one. The
    opposition, led by a coalition of Sunni Islamists, tribalists, some
    liberals, and myriad youth groups, largely boycotted legislative
    elections in 2012 and 2013 ushering in legislatures more amenable to
    the government's agenda. Since 2006, the Amir has dissolved the
    National Assembly on five occasions (the Constitutional Court annulled
    the Assembly in June 2012 and again in June 2013) and shuffled the
    cabinet over a dozen times, usually citing political stagnation and
    gridlock between the legislature and the government.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Kuwait has a geographically small, but wealthy, relatively open economy
    with crude oil reserves of about 102 billion barrels - more than 6% of
    world reserves. Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP, 95% of
    export revenues, and 95% of government income. Kuwaiti officials have
    committed to increasing oil production to 4 million barrels per day by
    2020. Budget surpluses have stayed around 30% of GDP, which has led to
    higher budget expenditures, particularly wage hikes for many public
    sector employees, as well as increased allotments to Kuwait’s Future
    Generations Fund. Kuwait has done little to diversify its economy, in
    part, because of this positive fiscal situation, and, in part, due to
    the poor business climate and the historically acrimonious relationship
    between the National Assembly and the executive branch, which has
    stymied most movement on economic reforms. In 2010, Kuwait passed an
    economic development plan that pledges to spend up to $130 billion over
    five years to diversify the economy away from oil, attract more
    investment, and boost private sector participation in the economy,
    though much of these funds have yet to be allocated.

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    Kuwait and Saudi Arabia continue negotiating a joint maritime boundary
    with Iran; no maritime boundary exists with Iraq in the Persian Gulf

  Refugees and internally displaced persons:
    stateless persons: 93,000 (2012); note - Kuwait's 1959 Nationality Law
    defined citizens as persons who settled in the country before 1920 and
    who had maintained normal residence since then; one-third of the
    population, descendants of Bedouin tribes, missed the window of
    opportunity to register for nationality rights after Kuwait became
    independent in 1961 and were classified as bidun (meaning without);
    since the 1980s Kuwait's bidun have progressively lost their rights,
    including opportunities for employment and education, amid official
    claims that they are nationals of other countries who have destroyed
    their identification documents in hopes of gaining Kuwaiti citizenship;
    Kuwaiti authorities have delayed processing citizenship applications
    and labeled biduns as "illegal residents," denying them access to civil
    documentation, such as birth and marriage certificates; 2011 bidun
    demonstrations for the recognition of their Kuwaiti nationality led to
    several arrests

  Trafficking in persons:
    current situation: Kuwait is a destination country for men and women
    subjected to forced labor and, to a lesser degree, forced prostitution;
    men and women migrate from India, Egypt, Bangladesh, Syria, Pakistan,
    the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Nepal, Iran, Jordan, Ethiopia,
    and Iraq to work in Kuwait, most of them in the domestic service,
    construction, and sanitation sectors; although most of these migrants
    enter Kuwait voluntarily, upon arrival some are subjected to conditions
    of forced labor by their sponsors and labor agents, including
    nonpayment of wages, long working hours without rest, deprivation of
    food, threats, physical or sexual abuse, and restrictions on movement,
    such as the withholding of passports or confinement to the workplace
