Saint Kitts and Nevis
=====================


Introduction

  Background:
    Carib Indians occupied the islands of the West Indies for hundreds of
    years before the British began settlement in 1623. In 1967, the island
    territory of Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla became an associated
    state of the UK with full internal autonomy. The island of Anguilla
    rebelled and was allowed to secede in 1971. The remaining islands
    achieved independence in 1983 as Saint Kitts and Nevis. In 1998, a vote
    in Nevis on a referendum to separate from Saint Kitts fell short of the
    two-thirds majority needed. Nevis continues in its efforts to separate
    from Saint Kitts.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    The economy of Saint Kitts and Nevis depends on tourism; since the
    1970s tourism has replaced sugar as the traditional mainstay of the
    economy. Following the 2005 harvest, the government closed the sugar
    industry, after several decades of losses. To compensate for lost jobs,
    the government has embarked on a program to diversify the agricultural
    sector and to stimulate other sectors of the economy, such as
    export-oriented manufacturing and offshore banking. Roughly 200,000
    tourists visited the islands in 2009, but reduced tourism arrivals and
    foreign investment led to an economic contraction in 2009-2012, and the
    economy returned to growth only in 2013. Like other tourist
    destinations in the Caribbean, St. Kitts and Nevis is vulnerable to
    damage from natural disasters and shifts in tourism demand. The
    government has made notable progress on reducing its public debt—from
    154% of GDP in 2011 to 83% in 2013—although it still faces one of the
    highest levels in the world, largely attributable to public enterprise
    losses.
