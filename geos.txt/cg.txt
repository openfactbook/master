Congo, Democratic Republic of the
=================================


Introduction

  Background:
    Established as a Belgian colony in 1908, the then-Republic of the Congo
    gained its independence in 1960, but its early years were marred by
    political and social instability. Col. Joseph MOBUTU seized power and
    declared himself president in a November 1965 coup. He subsequently
    changed his name - to MOBUTU Sese Seko - as well as that of the country
    - to Zaire. MOBUTU retained his position for 32 years through several
    sham elections, as well as through brutal force. Ethnic strife and
    civil war, touched off by a massive inflow of refugees in 1994 from
    fighting in Rwanda and Burundi, led in May 1997 to the toppling of the
    MOBUTU regime by a rebellion backed by Rwanda and Uganda and fronted by
    Laurent KABILA. He renamed the country the Democratic Republic of the
    Congo (DRC), but in August 1998 his regime was itself challenged by a
    second insurrection again backed by Rwanda and Uganda. Troops from
    Angola, Chad, Namibia, Sudan, and Zimbabwe intervened to support
    KABILA's regime. In January 2001, KABILA was assassinated and his son,
    Joseph KABILA, was named head of state. In October 2002, the new
    president was successful in negotiating the withdrawal of Rwandan
    forces occupying the eastern DRC; two months later, the Pretoria Accord
    was signed by all remaining warring parties to end the fighting and
    establish a government of national unity. A transitional government was
    set up in July 2003; it held a successful constitutional referendum in
    December 2005 and elections for the presidency, National Assembly, and
    provincial legislatures took place in 2006. In 2009, following a
    resurgence of conflict in the eastern DRC, the government signed a
    peace agreement with the National Congress for the Defense of the
    People (CNDP), a primarily Tutsi rebel group. An attempt to integrate
    CNDP members into the Congolese military failed, prompting their
    defection in 2012 and the formation of the M23 armed group - named
    after the 23 March 2009 peace agreements. Renewed conflict has lead to
    the displacement of large numbers of people and significant human
    rights abuses. As of February 2013, peace talks between the Congolese
    government and the M23 were on-going. In addition, the DRC continues to
    experience violence committed by other armed groups including the
    Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda and Mai Mai groups. In
    the most recent national elections, held in November 2011, disputed
    results allowed Joseph KABILA to be reelected to the presidency.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    The economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo - a nation endowed
    with vast natural resource wealth - is slowly recovering after decades
    of decline. Systemic corruption since independence in 1960, combined
    with country-wide instability and conflict that began in the mid-90s
    has dramatically reduced national output and government revenue and
    increased external debt. With the installation of a transitional
    government in 2003 after peace accords, economic conditions slowly
    began to improve as the transitional government reopened relations with
    international financial institutions and international donors, and
    President KABILA began implementing reforms. Progress has been slow to
    reach the interior of the country although clear changes are evident in
    Kinshasa and Lubumbashi. An uncertain legal framework, corruption, and
    a lack of transparency in government policy are long-term problems for
    the mining sector and for the economy as a whole. Much economic
    activity still occurs in the informal sector and is not reflected in
    GDP data. Renewed activity in the mining sector, the source of most
    export income, has boosted Kinshasa's fiscal position and GDP growth in
    recent years. The global recession cut economic growth in 2009 to less
    than half its 2008 level, but growth returned to around 7% per year in
    2010-12. The DRC signed a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility with
    the IMF in 2009 and received $12 billion in multilateral and bilateral
    debt relief in 2010, but the IMF at the end of 2012 suspended the last
    three payments under the loan facility - worth $240 million - because
    of concerns about the lack of transparency in mining contracts. In
    2012, the DRC updated its business laws by adhering to OHADA, the
    Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa. The
    country marked its tenth consecutive year of positive economic
    expansion in 2012.

  Telephone system:
    general assessment: barely adequate wire and microwave radio relay
    service in and between urban areas; domestic satellite system with 14
    earth stations; inadequate fixed line infrastructure
    domestic: state-owned operator providing less than 1 fixed-line
    connection per 100 persons; given the backdrop of a wholly inadequate
    fixed-line infrastructure, the use of mobile-cellular services has
    surged and mobile teledensity is roughly 20 per 100 persons

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    heads of the Great Lakes states and UN pledged in 2004 to abate tribal,
    rebel, and militia fighting in the region, including northeast Congo,
    where the UN Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the
    Congo (MONUC), organized in 1999, maintains over 16,500 uniformed
    peacekeepers; members of Uganda's Lords Resistance Army forces continue
    to seek refuge in Congo's Garamba National Park as peace talks with the
    Uganda government evolve; the location of the boundary in the broad
    Congo River with the Republic of the Congo is indefinite except in the
    Pool Malebo/Stanley Pool area; Uganda and DRC dispute Rukwanzi Island
    in Lake Albert and other areas on the Semliki River with hydrocarbon
    potential; boundary commission continues discussions over
    Congolese-administered triangle of land on the right bank of the
    Lunkinda River claimed by Zambia near the DRC village of Pweto; DRC
    accuses Angola of shifting monuments

  Refugees and internally displaced persons:
    refugees (country of origin): 43,674 (Rwanda); 9,762 (Burundi) (2013);
    56,150 (Central African Republic) (2014)
    IDPs: 2,634,872 (fighting between government forces and rebels since
    mid-1990s; most IDPs are in eastern provinces) (2014)

  Trafficking in persons:
    current situation: Democratic Republic of the Congo is a source,
    destination, and possibly a transit country for men, women, and
    children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking; the majority of
    this trafficking is internal, and much of it is perpetrated by armed
    groups and government forces outside government control within the
    country's unstable eastern provinces; Congolese women and children have
    been exploited internally as domestic servants, while others migrate to
    Angola, South Africa, Republic of the Congo, and South Sudan, as well
    as East African, Middle Eastern, and European nations where they are
    subjected to forced prostitution, domestic servitude, and forced labor
    in agriculture and diamond mines; indigenous and foreign armed groups
    (including the Lord's Resistance Army) abduct and forcibly recruit
    Congolese adults and children to serve as laborers, porters, domestics,
    combatants, and sex slaves; some commanders of the Congolese national
    army also recruit, at times through force, men and children for use as
    combatants, escorts, and porters
    tier rating: Tier 3 - The Democratic Republic of the Congo does not
    fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of
    trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so; the
    government signed a UN-backed action plan to end the recruitment and
    use of child soldiers within its armed forces but has not applied legal
    sanctions against those who recruit and use child soldiers and has not
    reported any law enforcement efforts to combat any other forms of
    trafficking; besides child soldiers, the government has not reported
    identifying any other victims of forced labor or sex trafficking or
    providing protective services or referrals to NGO-operated care
    facilities; NGOs continue to provide the vast majority of the limited
    shelter, legal, medical, and psychological services available to
    victims (2013)

  Illicit drugs:
    one of Africa's biggest producers of cannabis, but mostly for domestic
    consumption; traffickers exploit lax shipping controls to transit
    pseudoephedrine through the capital; while rampant corruption and
    inadequate supervision leaves the banking system vulnerable to money
    laundering, the lack of a well-developed financial system limits the
    country's utility as a money-laundering center (2008)
