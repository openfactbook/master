Montserrat
==========

(overseas territory of the UK)


Introduction

  Background:
    English and Irish colonists from St. Kitts first settled on Montserrat
    in 1632; the first African slaves arrived three decades later. The
    British and French fought for possession of the island for most of the
    18th century, but it finally was confirmed as a British possession in
    1783. The island's sugar plantation economy was converted to small farm
    landholdings in the mid 19th century. Much of this island was
    devastated and two-thirds of the population fled abroad because of the
    eruption of the Soufriere Hills Volcano that began on 18 July 1995.
    Montserrat has endured volcanic activity since, with the last eruption
    occurring in July 2003.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Severe volcanic activity, which began in July 1995, has put a damper on
    this small, open economy. A catastrophic eruption in June 1997 closed
    the airport and seaports, causing further economic and social
    dislocation. Two-thirds of the 12,000 inhabitants fled the island. Some
    began to return in 1998 but lack of housing limited the number. The
    agriculture sector continued to be affected by the lack of suitable
    land for farming and the destruction of crops. Prospects for the
    economy depend largely on developments in relation to the volcanic
    activity and on public sector construction activity. Half of the island
    remains uninhabitable. In January 2013, the EU announced the
    disbursement of a $55.2 million aid package to Montserrat in order to
    boost the country's economic recovery, with a specific focus on public
    finance management, public sector reform, and prudent economic
    management.
