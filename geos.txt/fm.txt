Micronesia, Federated States of
===============================


Introduction

  Background:
    The Caroline Islands are a widely scattered archipelago in the western
    Pacific Ocean; they became part of a UN Trust Territory under US
    administration following World War II. The eastern four island groups
    adopted a constitution in 1979 and chose to become the Federated States
    of Micronesia. (The fifth, westernmost island group became Palau.)
    Independence came in 1986 under a Compact of Free Association with the
    US, which was amended and renewed in 2004. Present concerns include
    large-scale unemployment, overfishing, and overdependence on US aid.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Economic activity consists of subsistence farming and fishing and
    government which is funded largely by Compact of Free Association
    (Compact) assistance provided by the US. The islands have few known
    mineral deposits worth commercial exploration. The potential for
    tourism is also limited by isolation, lack of adequate facilities, and
    limited air and water connections hinder development. Under the terms
    of the original Compact, the US provided $1.3 billion in grants and aid
    in 1986-2001. The US and the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM)
    negotiated a second (amended) Compact agreement in 2002-2003 that took
    effect in 2004. The amended Compact runs for a 20-year period to 2024;
    during which the US will provide roughly $2.1 billion to the FSM. The
    amended Compact also includes a Trust Fund for the people of the FSM
    which is to provide an income stream beyond 2024 when Compact grants
    are to end. The country's medium-term economic outlook appears fragile
    because of reduced US assistance and lackluster performance of its
    small and stagnant private sector.

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    none

  Trafficking in persons:
    current situation: Micronesia is a source, and to a limited extent,
    destination country for women subjected to sex trafficking; Micronesian
    women are fraudulently recruited for jobs in the US and its territories
    only to be forced into prostitution or labor upon arrival; Micronesian
    and foreign women and children are also reportedly prostituted on
    fishing vessels in Micronesia or its territorial waters, as well as
    restaurants and clubs frequented by fishermen; complaints of nonpayment
    and inhuman treatment on fishing boats has led to investigations of
    labor trafficking
    tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Micronesia does not fully comply with
    the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it
    is making significant efforts to do so; despite passage of implementing
    regulations for Micronesia's 2012 trafficking law, the government has
    not reported any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions for sex
    or labor trafficking; the government also makes no efforts to identify
    trafficking victims and refer them to protective services; no NGOs
    provide services to victims; limited efforts are made to increase the
    public's awareness of human trafficking (2013)

  Illicit drugs:
    major consumer of cannabis
