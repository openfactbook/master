Gibraltar
=========

(overseas territory of the UK)


Introduction

  Background:
    Strategically important, Gibraltar was reluctantly ceded to Great
    Britain by Spain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht; the British garrison
    was formally declared a colony in 1830. In a referendum held in 1967,
    Gibraltarians voted overwhelmingly to remain a British dependency. The
    subsequent granting of autonomy in 1969 by the UK led to Spain closing
    the border and severing all communication links. Between 1997 and 2002,
    the UK and Spain held a series of talks on establishing temporary joint
    sovereignty over Gibraltar. In response to these talks, the Gibraltar
    Government called a referendum in late 2002 in which the majority of
    citizens voted overwhelmingly against any sharing of sovereignty with
    Spain. Since late 2004, Spain, the UK, and Gibraltar have held
    tripartite talks with the aim of cooperatively resolving problems that
    affect the local population, and work continues on cooperation
    agreements in areas such as taxation and financial services;
    communications and maritime security; policy, legal and customs
    services; environmental protection; and education and visa services.
    Throughout 2009, a dispute over Gibraltar's claim to territorial waters
    extending out three miles gave rise to periodic non-violent maritime
    confrontations between Spanish and UK naval patrols and in 2013, the
    British reported a record number of entries by Spanish vessels into
    waters claimed by Gibraltar following a dispute over Gibraltar's
    creation of an artificial reef in those waters. A new noncolonial
    constitution came into effect in 2007, and the European Court of First
    Instance recognized Gibraltar's right to regulate its own tax regime in
    December 2008. The UK retains responsibility for defense, foreign
    relations, internal security, and financial stability.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Self-sufficient Gibraltar benefits from an extensive shipping trade,
    offshore banking, and its position as an international conference
    center. Tax rates are low to attract foreign investment. The British
    military presence has been sharply reduced and now contributes about 7%
    to the local economy, compared with 60% in 1984. The financial sector,
    tourism (over 11 million visitors in 2012), gaming revenues, shipping
    services fees, and duties on consumer goods also generate revenue. The
    financial sector, tourism, and the shipping sector contribute 30%, 30%,
    and 25%, respectively, of GDP. Telecommunications, e-commerce, and
    e-gaming account for the remaining 15%. In recent years, Gibraltar has
    seen major structural change from a public to a private sector economy,
    but changes in government spending still have a major impact on the
    level of employment.
