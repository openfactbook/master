Curacao
=======

(part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands)


Introduction

  Background:
    Originally settled by Arawak Indians, Curacao was seized by the Dutch
    in 1634 along with the neighboring island of Bonaire. Once the center
    of the Caribbean slave trade, Curacao was hard hit economically by the
    abolition of slavery in 1863. Its prosperity (and that of neighboring
    Aruba) was restored in the early 20th century with the construction of
    the Isla Refineria to service the newly discovered Venezuelan oil
    fields. In 1954, Curacao and several other Dutch Caribbean possessions
    were reorganized as the Netherlands Antilles, part of the Kingdom of
    the Netherlands. In referenda in 2005 and 2009, the citizens of Curacao
    voted to become a self-governing country within the Kingdom of the
    Netherlands. The change in status became effective in October 2010 with
    the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Tourism, petroleum refining, offshore finance, and trade and transport
    are the mainstays of this small economy, which is closely tied to the
    outside world. Although GDP grew slightly during the past decade, the
    island enjoys a high per capita income and a well-developed
    infrastructure compared with other countries in the region. Curacao has
    an excellent natural harbor that can accommodate large oil tankers.
    Venezuelan state oil company PdVSA, under a contract in effect until
    2019, leases the single refinery on the island from the government,
    employing some 1,500 people; most of the oil for the refinery is
    imported from Venezuela; most of the refined products are exported to
    the US. Almost all consumer and capital goods are imported, with the
    US, Brazil, Italy, and Mexico being the major suppliers. The government
    is attempting to diversify its industry and trade and has signed an
    Association Agreement with the EU to expand business there. Most of
    Curacaoâ€™s GDP results from services. Curacao has limited natural
    resources, poor soils, and inadequate water supplies, and budgetary
    problems complicate reform of the health and education systems. In 2013
    the government implemented changes to the sales tax and reformed the
    public pension and health care systems, including increasing the sales
    tax from 5% to as high as 9% on some products, raising the age for
    public pension withdrawals to 65, and requiring citizens to pay higher
    premiums.
