Lebanon
=======


Introduction

  Background:
    Following World War I, France acquired a mandate over the northern
    portion of the former Ottoman Empire province of Syria. The French
    demarcated the region of Lebanon in 1920 and granted this area
    independence in 1943. Since independence the country has been marked by
    periods of political turmoil interspersed with prosperity built on its
    position as a regional center for finance and trade. The country's
    1975-90 civil war that resulted in an estimated 120,000 fatalities, was
    followed by years of social and political instability. Sectarianism is
    a key element of Lebanese political life. Neighboring Syria has long
    influenced Lebanon's foreign policy and internal policies, and its
    military occupied Lebanon from 1976 until 2005. The Lebanon-based
    Hizballah militia and Israel continued attacks and counterattacks
    against each other after Syria's withdrawal, and fought a brief war in
    2006. Lebanon's borders with Syria and Israel remain unresolved.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Lebanon has a free-market economy and a strong laissez-faire commercial
    tradition. The government does not restrict foreign investment;
    however, the investment climate suffers from red tape, corruption,
    arbitrary licensing decisions, complex customs procedures, high taxes,
    tariffs, and fees, archaic legislation, and weak intellectual property
    rights. The Lebanese economy is service-oriented; main growth sectors
    include banking and tourism. The 1975-90 civil war seriously damaged
    Lebanon's economic infrastructure, cut national output by half, and
    derailed Lebanon's position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking
    hub. Following the civil war, Lebanon rebuilt much of its war-torn
    physical and financial infrastructure by borrowing heavily, mostly from
    domestic banks, which saddled the government with a huge debt burden.
    Pledges of economic and financial reforms made at separate
    international donor conferences during the 2000s have mostly gone
    unfulfilled, including those made during the Paris III Donor Conference
    in 2007 following the July 2006 war. The collapse of the MIKATI
    government in early 2011 over its backing of the Special Tribunal for
    Lebanon and the conflict in neighboring Syria slowed economic growth to
    the 1-2% range in 2011-13, after four years of 8% average growth. In
    September 2011 the Cabinet endorsed a bill that would provide $1.2
    billion in funding to improve Lebanon's downtrodden electricity sector,
    but fiscal limitations will test the government's ability to invest in
    other areas, such as water.

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    lacking a treaty or other documentation describing the boundary,
    portions of the Lebanon-Syria boundary are unclear with several
    sections in dispute; since 2000, Lebanon has claimed Shab'a Farms area
    in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights; the roughly 2,000-strong UN
    Interim Force in Lebanon has been in place since 1978

  Refugees and internally displaced persons:
    refugees (country of origin): 447,328 (Palestinian refugees (UNRWA));
    1,107,550 (Syria) (2014)
    IDPs: at least 20,000 (2007 Lebanese security forces' destruction of
    Palestinian refugee camp) (2013)

  Trafficking in persons:
    current situation: Lebanon is a source, transit, and destination
    country for women and children subjected to forced labor and sex
    trafficking; Eastern European women and children are transported
    through Lebanon for sexual exploitation in other Middle Eastern
    countries; women from Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Ethiopia, Kenya,
    Bangladesh, Nepal, Madagascar, Congo, Togo, Cameroon, and Nigeria are
    recruited by agencies to work in domestic service but are often subject
    to conditions indicative of forced labor, including the withholding of
    passports, nonpayment of wages, restricted movement, threats, and
    abuse; Lebanon's artiste visa program enabling women to work as dancers
    for three months in the adult entertainment industry sustains a
    significant sex trade; anecdotal information indicates some Lebanese
    children are victims of forced labor, such as street begging and
    commercial sexual exploitation; Syrian refugee women and children in
    Lebanon are at increased risk of sex trafficking
    tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Lebanon does not fully comply with the
    minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is
    making significant efforts to do so; the government conducts
    investigations of human trafficking and possibly some prosecutions but
    for another year did not report convicting any trafficking offenders or
    officials complicit in human trafficking; the government continues to
    lack a formal system for identifying victims and does not have a policy
    to protect victims from being punished for crimes committed as a direct
    result of being trafficked; NGOs, rather than the government, provide
    victim assistance and protection (2013)

  Illicit drugs:
    cannabis cultivation dramatically reduced to 2,500 hectares in 2002
    despite continued significant cannabis consumption; opium poppy
    cultivation minimal; small amounts of Latin American cocaine and
    Southwest Asian heroin transit country on way to European markets and
    for Middle Eastern consumption; money laundering of drug proceeds fuels
    concern that extremists are benefiting from drug trafficking
