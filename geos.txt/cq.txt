Northern Mariana Islands
========================

(commonwealth in political union with the US)


Introduction

  Background:
    Under US administration as part of the UN Trust Territory of the
    Pacific, the people of the Northern Mariana Islands decided in the
    1970s not to seek independence but instead to forge closer links with
    the US. Negotiations for territorial status began in 1972. A covenant
    to establish a commonwealth in political union with the US was approved
    in 1975, and came into force on 24 March 1976. A new government and
    constitution went into effect in 1978.
