Tajikistan
==========


Introduction

  Background:
    The Tajik people came under Russian rule in the 1860s and 1870s, but
    Russia's hold on Central Asia weakened following the Revolution of
    1917. Bands of indigenous guerrillas (called "basmachi") fiercely
    contested Bolshevik control of the area, which was not fully
    reestablished until 1925. Tajikistan was first created as an autonomous
    republic within Uzbekistan in 1924, but the USSR designated Tajikistan
    a separate republic in 1929 and transferred to it much of present-day
    Sughd province. Ethnic Uzbeks form a substantial minority in
    Tajikistan. Tajikistan became independent in 1991 following the breakup
    of the Soviet Union, and experienced a civil war between regional
    factions from 1992 to 1997. Tajikistan endured several domestic
    security incidents during 2010-12, including armed conflict between
    government forces and local strongmen in the Rasht Valley and between
    government forces and criminal groups in Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous
    Oblast. The country remains the poorest in the former Soviet sphere.
    Tajikistan became a member of the World Trade Organization in March
    2013. However, its economy continues to face major challenges,
    including dependence on remittances from Tajikistanis working in
    Russia, pervasive corruption, and the major role narcotrafficking plays
    in the country's informal economy.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Tajikistan has one of the lowest per capita GDPs among the 15 former
    Soviet republics. The 1992-1997 civil war severely damaged an already
    weak economic infrastructure and caused a sharp decline in industrial
    and agricultural production. Because of a lack of employment
    opportunities in Tajikistan, more than one million Tajik citizens work
    abroad - roughly 90% in Russia - supporting families in Tajikistan
    through remittances. Less than 7% of the land area is arable and cotton
    is the most important crop. Until 2008, cotton production was closely
    monitored and controlled by the government. In the wake of the National
    Bank of Tajikistan's admission in December 2007 that it had directed
    the AgroInvestBank to improperly lend money to politically connected
    investors in the cotton sector, the IMF canceled its stand-by
    assistance program in Tajikistan. As part of the Tajik government’s
    subsequent reforms, over a half billion dollars in farmer debt has been
    forgiven. In 2008 Tajikistan passed new law authorizing farmers to
    decide for themselves what crops to grow, and this has resulted in a
    gradual decrease in cotton output. Tajikistan imports approximately 60%
    of its food, most of which comes by rail. Uzbekistan closed one of the
    rail lines into Tajikistan in late 2011, hampering the transit of goods
    to and from the southern part of the country. As a result, food and
    fuel prices increased to the highest levels since 2002. Mineral
    resources include silver, gold, uranium, and tungsten. Industry
    consists mainly of small obsolete factories in food processing and
    light industry, substantial hydropower facilities, and a large aluminum
    plant - currently operating below 25% of capacity. Electricity output
    expanded with the completion of the Sangtuda-1 hydropower dam -
    finished in 2009 with Russian investment. The smaller Sangtuda-2
    hydropower dam, built with Iranian investment, began operating in 2012
    at a limited capacity. The Tajik government is tens of millions of
    dollars in arrears for both Sangtuda dams, and Sangtuda-2 has been
    closed for “maintenance” since January 2014. The government is
    pinning its drive for energy independence on completion of the Roghun
    dam, which is scheduled for mid-2014. In 2010, the government began a
    coerced sale of shares in the Roghun enterprise to its population,
    ultimately raising over $180 million before stopping under intense
    criticism from international donors, but the dam is likely to cost
    billions of dollars. The World Bank funded two feasibility studies
    (technical-economic, and social-environmental) for the dam. If built
    according to plan, Roghun will be the tallest dam in the world, will
    operate year around, and will significantly expand Tajikistan’s
    electricity output. In 2013, the Tajik government finalized an
    agreement to import one million tons of fuel and oil products from
    Russia each year, at reduced prices. Tajikistan's economic situation
    remains fragile due to uneven implementation of structural reforms,
    corruption, weak governance, seasonal power shortages, and its large
    external debt burden.
