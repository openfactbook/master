Bosnia and Herzegovina
======================


Introduction

  Background:
    Bosnia and Herzegovina declared sovereignty in October 1991 and
    independence from the former Yugoslavia on 3 March 1992 after a
    referendum boycotted by ethnic Serbs. The Bosnian Serbs - supported by
    neighboring Serbia and Montenegro - responded with armed resistance
    aimed at partitioning the republic along ethnic lines and joining
    Serb-held areas to form a "Greater Serbia." In March 1994, Bosniaks and
    Croats reduced the number of warring factions from three to two by
    signing an agreement creating a joint Bosniak/Croat Federation of
    Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 21 November 1995, in Dayton, Ohio, the
    warring parties initialed a peace agreement that ended three years of
    interethnic civil strife (the final agreement was signed in Paris on 14
    December 1995). The Dayton Peace Accords retained Bosnia and
    Herzegovina's international boundaries and created a multi-ethnic and
    democratic government charged with conducting foreign, diplomatic, and
    fiscal policy. Also recognized was a second tier of government composed
    of two entities roughly equal in size: the Bosniak/Bosnian Croat
    Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb-led Republika
    Srpska (RS). The Federation and RS governments are responsible for
    overseeing most government functions. Additionally, the Dayton Accords
    established the Office of the High Representative (OHR) to oversee the
    implementation of the civilian aspects of the agreement. The Peace
    Implementation Council (PIC) at its conference in Bonn in 1997 also
    gave the High Representative the authority to impose legislation and
    remove officials, the so-called "Bonn Powers." An original NATO-led
    international peacekeeping force (IFOR) of 60,000 troops assembled in
    1995 was succeeded over time by a smaller, NATO-led Stabilization Force
    (SFOR). In 2004, European Union peacekeeping troops (EUFOR) replaced
    SFOR. Currently EUFOR deploys around 600 troops in theater in a
    policing capacity.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    Bosnia has a transitional economy with limited market reforms. The
    economy relies heavily on the export of metals, energy, textiles and
    furniture as well as on remittances and foreign aid. A highly
    decentralized government hampers economic policy coordination and
    reform, while excessive bureaucracy and a segmented market discourage
    foreign investment. The interethnic warfare in Bosnia and Herzegovina
    caused production to plummet by 80% from 1992 to 1995 and unemployment
    to soar. With an uneasy peace in place, output recovered in 1996-99 but
    slowed in 2000-02 and picked up again during 2003-08, when GDP growth
    exceeded 5% per year. However, the country declined in 2009 reflecting
    local effects of the global economic crisis. GDP growth contracted
    again in 2012, but posted a small gain in 2013. Foreign banks,
    primarily from Austria and Italy, now control most of the banking
    sector. The konvertibilna marka (convertible mark or BAM) - the
    national currency introduced in 1998 - is pegged to the euro, and
    confidence in the currency and the banking sector has remained stable.
    Bosnia's private sector is growing slowly, but foreign investment has
    dropped sharply since 2007. Government spending - including transfer
    payments - remains high, at roughly 40% of GDP, because of redundant
    government offices at the state, entity and municipal level.
    Privatization of state enterprises has been slow, particularly in the
    Federation, where political division between ethnically-based political
    parties makes agreement on economic policy more difficult. High
    unemployment remains the most serious macroeconomic problem. Successful
    implementation of a value-added tax in 2006 provided a steady source of
    revenue for the government and helped rein in gray-market activity.
    National-level statistics have also improved over time but a large
    share of economic activity remains unofficial and unrecorded. Bosnia
    and Herzegovina became a full member of the Central European Free Trade
    Agreement in September 2007. Bosnia and Herzegovina's top economic
    priorities are: acceleration of integration into the EU; strengthening
    the fiscal system; public administration reform; World Trade
    Organization (WTO) membership; and securing economic growth by
    fostering a dynamic, competitive private sector. In 2009, Bosnia and
    Herzegovina was granted an International Monetary Fund (IMF) stand-by
    arrangement, necessitated by sharply increased social spending and a
    fiscal crisis exacerbated by the global economic downturn. Disbursement
    of IMF aid was suspended in 2011 after a parliamentary deadlock left
    Bosnia without a state-level government for over a year. The IMF
    concluded a new stand-by arrangement with Bosnia in October 2012 which
    aims to improve national policy coordination, continue fiscal
    contraction, improve crisis preparedness, and create an environment
    conducive to private sector development.
