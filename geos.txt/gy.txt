Guyana
======


Introduction

  Background:
    Originally a Dutch colony in the 17th century, by 1815 Guyana had
    become a British possession. The abolition of slavery led to settlement
    of urban areas by former slaves and the importation of indentured
    servants from India to work the sugar plantations. The resulting
    ethnocultural divide has persisted and has led to turbulent politics.
    Guyana achieved independence from the UK in 1966, and since then it has
    been ruled mostly by socialist-oriented governments. In 1992, Cheddi
    JAGAN was elected president in what is considered the country's first
    free and fair election since independence. After his death five years
    later, his wife, Janet JAGAN, became president but resigned in 1999 due
    to poor health. Her successor, Bharrat JAGDEO, was reelected in 2001
    and again in 2006. Donald RAMOTAR was elected president in 2011.

People and Society

  Nationality:
    noun: Guyanese (singular and plural)
    adjective: Guyanese

  Ethnic groups:
    East Indian 43.5%, black (African) 30.2%, mixed 16.7%, Amerindian 9.1%,
    other 0.5% (2002 census)

  Languages:
    English, Amerindian dialects, Creole, Caribbean Hindustani (a dialect
    of Hindi), Urdu

  Religions:
    Protestant 30.5% (Pentecostal 16.9%, Anglican 6.9%, Seventh Day
    Adventist 5%, Methodist 1.7%), Hindu 28.4%, Roman Catholic 8.1%, Muslim
    7.2%, Jehovah's Witnesses 1.1%, other Christian 17.7%, other 1.9%, none
    4.3%, unspecified 0.9% (2002 est.)

  Demographic profile:
    Guyana is the only English-speaking country in South America and shares
    cultural and historical bonds with the Anglophone Caribbean. Guyana's
    two largest ethnic groups are the Afro-Guyanese (descendants of African
    slaves) and the Indo-Guyanese (descendants of Indian indentured
    laborers), which together comprise about three quarters of Guyana's
    population. Tensions periodically have boiled over between the two
    groups, which back ethnically based political parties and vote along
    ethnic lines. Poverty reduction has stagnated since the late 1990s.
    About one-third of the Guyanese population lives below the poverty
    line; indigenous people are disproportionately affected. Although
    Guyana's literacy rate is reported to be among the highest in the
    Western Hemisphere, the level of functional literacy is considerably
    lower, which has been attributed to poor education quality, teacher
    training, and infrastructure.
    Guyana's emigration rate is among the highest in the world - more than
    55% of its citizens reside abroad - and it is one of the largest
    recipients of remittances relative to GDP among Latin American and
    Caribbean counties. Although remittances are a vital source of income
    for most citizens, the pervasive emigration of skilled workers deprives
    Guyana of professionals in healthcare and other key sectors. More than
    80% of Guyanese nationals with tertiary level educations have
    emigrated. Brain drain and the concentration of limited medical
    resources in Georgetown hamper Guyana's ability to meet the health
    needs of its predominantly rural population. Guyana has one of the
    highest HIV prevalence rates in the region and continues to rely on
    international support for its HIV treatment and prevention programs.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    The Guyanese economy exhibited moderate economic growth in recent years
    and is based largely on agriculture and extractive industries. The
    economy is heavily dependent upon the export of six commodities -
    sugar, gold, bauxite, shrimp, timber, and rice - which represent nearly
    60% of the country's GDP and are highly susceptible to adverse weather
    conditions and fluctuations in commodity prices. Guyana's entrance into
    the Caricom Single Market and Economy (CSME) in January 2006 has
    broadened the country's export market, primarily in the raw materials
    sector. Guyana has experienced positive growth almost every year over
    the past decade. Inflation has been kept under control. Recent years
    have seen the government's stock of debt reduced significantly - with
    external debt now less than half of what it was in the early 1990s.
    Chronic problems include a shortage of skilled labor and a deficient
    infrastructure. Despite recent improvements, the government is still
    juggling a sizable external debt against the urgent need for expanded
    public investment. In March 2007, the Inter-American Development Bank,
    Guyana's principal donor, canceled Guyana's nearly $470 million debt,
    equivalent to 21% of GDP, which along with other Highly Indebted Poor
    Country (HIPC) debt forgiveness brought the debt-to-GDP ratio down from
    183% in 2006 to 60% in 2013. Guyana had become heavily indebted as a
    result of the inward-looking, state-led development model pursued in
    the 1970s and 1980s. Much of Guyana's growth in recent years has come
    from a surge in gold production in response to global prices, although
    downward trends in gold prices may threaten future growth. In 2013,
    production of sugar dropped to a 23-year low.

Transnational Issues

  Disputes - international:
    all of the area west of the Essequibo River is claimed by Venezuela
    preventing any discussion of a maritime boundary; Guyana has expressed
    its intention to join Barbados in asserting claims before UN Convention
    on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) that Trinidad and Tobago's maritime
    boundary with Venezuela extends into their waters; Suriname claims a
    triangle of land between the New and Kutari/Koetari rivers in a
    historic dispute over the headwaters of the Courantyne; Guyana seeks
    arbitration under provisions of the UNCLOS to resolve the long-standing
    dispute with Suriname over the axis of the territorial sea boundary in
    potentially oil-rich waters

  Trafficking in persons:
    current situation: Guyana is a source and destination country for men,
    women, and children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor;
    Guyanese and foreign women and girls are forced into prostitution in
    Guyana; experts are concerned that Guyanese children are subjected to
    exploitive labor practices in the mining, agriculture, and forestry
    sectors; Indonesian workers are victims of forced labor on
    Guyanese-flagged fishing boats
    tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Guyana does not fully comply with the
    minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is
    making significant efforts to do so; despite some progress in
    identifying and assisting some trafficking victims, the government has
    failed to increase its efforts to hold trafficking offenders
    accountable with jail time, creating an enabling environment for human
    trafficking; public comments from the government downplaying the scope
    of Guyana's trafficking problem diminishes the potential impact of its
    awareness campaigns; authorities operate a hotline for trafficking
    victims and conduct several awareness and sensitization sessions that
    target vulnerable communities (2013)

  Illicit drugs:
    transshipment point for narcotics from South America - primarily
    Venezuela - to Europe and the US; producer of cannabis; rising money
    laundering related to drug trafficking and human smuggling
