Greenland
=========

(part of the Kingdom of Denmark)


Introduction

  Background:
    Greenland, the world's largest island, is about 81% ice-capped. Vikings
    reached the island in the 10th century from Iceland; Danish
    colonization began in the 18th century, and Greenland was made an
    integral part of Denmark in 1953. It joined the European Community (now
    the EU) with Denmark in 1973 but withdrew in 1985 over a dispute
    centered on stringent fishing quotas. Greenland was granted
    self-government in 1979 by the Danish parliament; the law went into
    effect the following year. Greenland voted in favor of increased
    self-rule in November 2008 and acquired greater responsibility for
    internal affairs when the Act on Greenland Self-Government was signed
    into law in June 2009. Denmark, however, continues to exercise control
    over several policy areas on behalf of Greenland including foreign
    affairs, security, and financial policy in consultation with
    Greenland's Self-Rule Government.

Economy

  Economy - overview:
    The economy remains critically dependent on exports of shrimp and fish,
    income from resource exploration and extraction, and on a substantial
    subsidy from the Danish Government. The subsidy was budgeted to be
    about $651 million in 2012, approximately 56% of government revenues
    that year. The public sector, including publicly owned enterprises and
    the municipalities, plays the dominant role in Greenland's economy.
    Greenland's real GDP contracted about 1% in 2009 as a result of the
    global economic slowdown, but is estimated to have grown marginally in
    2010-13. The relative ease with which Greenland has weathered the
    economic crisis is due to increased hydrocarbon and mineral exploration
    and extraction activities, a high level of construction activity in the
    Nuuk area and the increasing price of fish and shrimp. During the last
    decade the Greenland Home Rule Government (GHRG) pursued conservative
    fiscal and monetary policies, but public pressure has increased for
    better schools, health care and retirement systems. The Greenlandic
    economy has benefited from increasing catches and exports of shrimp,
    Greenland halibut and, more recently, crabs. Due to Greenland's
    continued dependence on exports of fish - which accounted for 89% of
    exports in 2010 - the economy remains very sensitive to foreign
    developments. International consortia are increasingly active in
    exploring for hydrocarbon resources off Greenland's western coast, and
    international studies indicate the potential for oil and gas fields in
    northern and northeastern Greenland. In May 2007 a US aluminum producer
    concluded a memorandum of understanding with the Greenland Home Rule
    Government to build an aluminum smelter and a power generation
    facility, which takes advantage of Greenland's abundant hydropower
    potential. Within the area of mining, olivine sand continues to be
    produced and gold production has resumed in south Greenland, while
    rare-earth and iron ore mineral projects have been proposed or planned
    elsewhere on the island. Tourism also offers another avenue of economic
    growth for Greenland, with increasing numbers of cruise lines now
    operating in Greenland's western and southern waters during the peak
    summer tourism season.
